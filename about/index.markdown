Hello, there. I'm [Pete](http://en.gravatar.com/johnsyweb) and I shall be
hosting this website for you and people like you to read. You are very welcome.
If you wish to reproduce any part of this website, I ask that you give me credit
in the reproduction. Thank you.

I've never been entirely sure what to put up on this website. I don't
particularly enjoy talking about myself, but I do enjoy sharing my
experiences with my family, my friends and those I haven't met yet on the
pages of this site.

These pages mostly serve as a reference for me. As time goes by my memory seems
to be getting worse and I don't keep a diary, so I tend to put stuff in my
[blog](/blog) to look at later, wherever I am. If you find it useful or
entertaining, then that is an added bonus.

So that's what I do, I write computer code, programs, software, whatever you
want to call it. I do it for fun on the whole but since I graduated with a
degree in Software Engineering from The University of Birmingham, a small
succession of companies have chosen to pay me to design and write software for
them. This is very kind of them. I consider myself very lucky that I get paid to
do something that I enjoy.

I work on the development team at [Envato](http://techjobs.envato.com/), who
are awesome (and still hiring). If you are interested in the kind of work I have
done, I have documented a fair amount of it at [Careers 2.0 (by Stack
Overflow)](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/johnsyweb) I prefer this to a
traditional resume as it's easier to keep up-to-date (some of it is updated
automatically).

I am currently based in the marvellous city of Melbourne, Australia, where I
live with my ever-charming wife, [Kirsty](http://thribble.blogspot.com). We
moved to Australia at the end of 2005 as _K_ likes the warm weather and I
love the smell of eucalyptus in the morning. Since moving here, our family has
grown to include two splendid sons who provide us with hours of fun.

I'm always interested to hear from people reading this site and to learn what
they think. Details on how to [contact me](/contact/) are elsewhere on this
site. You are intelligent enough to navigate your way around these pages. If you
can't do it, then I haven't designed the layout correctly, so please let me
know.

Nice to have met you!
