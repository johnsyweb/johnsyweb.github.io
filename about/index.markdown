Hello, there. I'm Pete and I shall be publishing these pages for you and
people like you to read. You are very welcome. If you wish to reproduce any
part of this website, I ask that you give me credit in the reproduction. Thank
you.

I've been using the handle "johnsyweb" online since the mid-1990s. I like to
use my initials, in lowercase, "paj" as my login where I can, but this username
was often taken before I got to create an account on most sites. Some of my
friends call me "johnsy", so I tried that as a username for a while, but that
was also often taken. Then I added "web" as I was using it to log into
websites. And that kind of stuck.

My home, where I write most of this text and where my family enjoy life, is
situated on the land of the [Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung People][Wurundjeri] of the
[Kulin Nation][Kulin], whom I respectfully acknowledge as the Traditional
Owners, and I pay my respects to their Elders past and present, as well as to
any Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people reading these words.

I don't particularly enjoy talking about myself, but I do enjoy sharing my
experiences with my family, my friends and those I haven't met yet on these
pages. It's also nice to go back and read what I once thought I knew about a
subject.

Details on how to [contact me][Contact] are elsewhere. You are intelligent
enough to navigate your way around these pages. If you can't do it, then I
haven't designed the layout correctly, so please let me know.

Nice to have met you!
