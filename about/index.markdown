Hello, there. I'm Pete and I shall be publishing these pages for you and people
like you to read. You are very welcome. If you wish to reproduce any part of
this website, I ask that you give me credit in the reproduction. Thank you.

I don't particularly enjoy talking about myself, but I do enjoy sharing my
experiences with my family, my friends and those I haven't met yet on these
pages. It's also nice to go back and read what I once thought I knew about a
subject.

Details on how to [contact me](/contact/) are elsewhere. You are intelligent
enough to navigate your way around these pages. If you can't do it, then I
haven't designed the layout correctly, so please let me know.

Nice to have met you!
