I haven't looked back since [I ran my first
parkrun][westerfolds-35]
last June. You may remember I mentioned [parkrun][parkrun-home] once
or twice in [my year of running]({% post_url 2015-03-01-my-year-of-running %}). It gets
me out of bed of a Saturday morning (hence encouraging me not to over-indulge
after work on a Friday), it has helped me improve my running and I've made
some good friends through it.

Most of my parkruns have been at [Westerfolds
parkrun][westerfolds], with a few tourist runs.
[Westerfolds Park][westerfolds-park] is beautiful,
but it is a bit of a trek from where we live. In fact, heading to parkrun is
about the only time I use our car these days.

After a pre-run briefing last month, the local Territory Director mentioned that
he was looking to form a parkrun in my home suburb of Coburg. We got talking
after that morning's run and from there started planning [Coburg
parkrun][coburg], which I am pleased to say will
launch on 16 May 2015!

The official webpage went up today and it was a bitter-sweet moment when I
switched my "Home run" from Westerfolds to Coburg. I shall miss my regular
Saturday morning run with friends there (but look forward to being a tourist in
future). That said, I'm delighted to be able to give something back to parkrun.
It's a superb global community, mostly run by volunteers, who provide a social
way to enjoy keeping fit and healthy. I'm looking forward providing Coburg with
its own parkrun and seeing it grow as Westerfolds has grown.

If it's your thing, you can follow [Coburg parkrun][coburg] on
[Facebook][facebook], [Instagram][instagram],
or [Twitter][twitter]. Perhaps I'll see you there for a
run if you're in the area?

Thanks for your support!
