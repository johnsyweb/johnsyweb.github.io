I haven't looked back since [I ran my first
parkrun](http://www.parkrun.com.au/westerfolds/results/weeklyresults/?runSeqNumber=35)
last June. You may remember I mentioned [parkrun](http://www.parkrun.com/) once
or twice in [my year of running](/blog/2015/03/01/my_year_of_running/). It gets
me out of bed of a Saturday morning (hence encouraging me not to over-indulge
after work on a Friday), it has helped me improve my running and I've made
some good friends through it.

Most of my parkruns have been at [Westerfolds
parkrun](http://www.parkrun.com.au/westerfolds/), with a few tourist runs.
[Westerfolds Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerfolds_Park) is beautiful,
but it is a bit of a trek from where we live. In fact, heading to parkrun is
about the only time I use our car these days.

After a pre-run briefing last month, the local Territory Director mentioned that
he was looking to form a parkrun in my home suburb of Coburg. We got talking
after that morning's run and from there started planning [Coburg
parkrun](http://www.parkrun.com.au/coburg/), which I am pleased to say will
launch on 16 May 2015!

The official webpage went up today and it was a bitter-sweet moment when I
switched my "Home run" from Westerfolds to Coburg. I shall miss my regular
Saturday morning run with friends there (but look forward to being a tourist in
future). That said, I'm delighted to be able to give something back to parkrun.
It's a superb global community, mostly run by volunteers, who provide a social
way to enjoy keeping fit and healthy. I'm looking forward providing Coburg with
its own parkrun and seeing it grow as Westerfolds has grown.
