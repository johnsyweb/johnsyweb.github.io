title: Good Day

It's a good day, I can tell you, when you hear [The legendary Murray
Walker](http://carpoint.ninemsn.com.au/car-review/1610248.aspx) being
interviewed on Australian radio and talking about his &quot;very good
friends&quot; Nigel Mansell and Damon Hill winning World Championships!


Sadly, I cannot hear the F1 action from my office, it's about 14km from [Albert
Park](http://cars.grandprix.com.au/). _K_ assures me that she can hear
&quot;fast cars&quot; from her office. Life is unfair.


On the upside, I get to stroll down to Albert Park on Sunday to watch the race.
The official website seems to be under a lot of strain at the moment, so I
cannot get on and look up the program of events this lunchtime. Hey-ho, I'm sure
it will be excellent, whatever.


On an unrelated note, I'm now running v7.0 (Beta) of [Vim](http://www.vim.org/),
which has some very natty spell-checking. This may or may not improve the
quality of my blog entries and emails.
