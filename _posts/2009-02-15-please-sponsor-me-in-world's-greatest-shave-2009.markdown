title: Please sponsor me in World's Greatest Shave 2009!
---

Dear treasured blog reader,


<strong>I really need a haircut!</strong> But I'm putting it off for another
month, because I'm taking part in the [Leukaemia Foundation World's Greatest
Shave](https://www.worldsgreatestshave.com/) on 14 March 2009.


Please take a moment to look at [my Profile
Page](https://my.imisfriendraising.com.au/personalPage.aspx?SID=54895). While
you're there, I'd like you to support me by making a secure online donation
using your credit card. Or whomsoever's you have to hand!


I'm told that every hour of every day, at least one person in Australia is
diagnosed with leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma and that every two hours, someone
loses their life to blood cancer. So, _please_ help me raise as much as I can
for the [Leukaemia Foundation](https://www.leukaemia.org.au/). Their vital work
provides patients with practical support during their long and tough treatment,
as well as funding important research.


Photographic evidence shall be shared.


Many, many thanks in advance!
