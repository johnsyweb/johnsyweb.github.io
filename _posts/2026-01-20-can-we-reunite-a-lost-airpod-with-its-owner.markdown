Today I found a single right AirPod in the grass near a skate park where one of the kids was having fun. Between this little bud, the iPhone in my bag, and the worldwide Apple network, surely we should be able to get it back to its owner without compromising anyone's privacy. Doing that would be good for the person who lost it _and_ for the planet.

## The technology exists

AirPods appear in the owner's "[Find My]" service, so the owner can see a last-seen location when another Apple device passes nearby. Apple's current guidance lives at [Find your lost AirPods with Find My][apple-find-my-lost-airpods]. However, only certain models are supported and there is no obvious “tap to contact the owner” flow like an AirTag has. A single bud without its case can be hard to spot in Find My (as it was in the grass) and can't chirp loudly enough to guide a passer-by.

## What I wish Apple would add

A true "found mode" that lets a finder scan or tap the bud and send a privacy-protected relay message to the owner (similar to AirTag), without exposing either party's contact details. And an option in Find My to flag "safe drop-off" at an Apple Store or partner, so the owner can reclaim it or Apple can refurbish or recycle it after a suitable period, rather than having it go to landfill. That would align nicely with the promises in [Tim Cook's Mother Nature video][mother-nature] (which was surprisingly hard to find today) and the [2030 carbon-neutral roadmap][apple-2030].

## While Apple figures that out

There is a found AirPod sitting at the back of the bench nearest the playground at [Keilor Downs Skate Park][maps-apple]. If it's yours, you can head there, check the spot, and try playing a sound from Find My.
