Yesterday was an excellent day. As previously mentioned, we had an early start
to drive into the City. In the City, we boarded our 27-seater 4&#0215;4 bus; a
weird and wonderful vehicle and very, very comfortable, it has to be said. The
bus drove us North of Perth, to the Pinnacles Desert, making a couple of stops
along the way. These stops were largely to give us a break on the long journey,
but were also there to give us a glimpse of Australian life outside the city. We
saw a solitary koala, munching on some eucalyptus leaves, but nothing of real
excitement.... until we reached some rather large sand dunes. This is where the
27-seater 4&#0215;4 came into its own. It mounted the sand dunes without too
much effort and hurtled down the other side. Being in a bus going over the edge
like that was pretty exciting and made me think of the Italian Job! Some of us
took the opportunity to witness the bus going over the dunes from the outside,
affording us the opportunity to record the occasion for our own posterity. 


After the driver had finished throwing us around the sand dunes, he offered us
some &quot;sandboards&quot;, so that we may have a go at flinging ourselves down
these sand dunes at speed. Alas, the sand was not as dry as we might have hoped,
so the speed was 'slow'.


Onward, then, to the main attraction, The Pinnacles! Having been sat on a coach
for half the day, I was beginning to wonder if I might be disappointed by the
phenomenon that us The Pinnacles. Would it all be worth it? As we made the final
approach to the desert, I knew that it was worth it. Not one of the photos that
I took in the hour that we spent in between these large natural structures could
do justice to the magnificence that they portray or the vastness of the whole
spectacular. The Pinnacles really do have to be seen to be believed. And seen
close up -- no amount of megapixels could demonstrate how awesome a sight the
Pinnacles make up. Very much worth spending a day on a coach to see!


We kept our travelling down to a minimum today, choosing to visit a local
winery at Sandalford to find out how they do things and to sample their wares.
There are many worse ways to spend a sunny afternoon in Western Australia, I
am sure of that! So, sample we did and we did not come away empty-handed.
Neither did our hosts, so I guess we can call that another successful
excursion.


This evening saw us visiting a _drive-through bottle store_ to pick up
a couple of ice cold beers to accompany our pizza and video evening. A
_drive-through bottle store_! Something, I imagine we'll not be seeing
in the UK before we see The Pinnacles there!


Tomorrow we head off to Rottnest Island to meet some Quokkas. Stay tuned for
more exciting adventures!
