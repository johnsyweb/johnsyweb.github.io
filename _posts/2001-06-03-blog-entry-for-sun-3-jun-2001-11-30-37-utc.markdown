Alas, my time in Perth draws to a close, tomorrow we leave for Sydney (NSW).
This seems like a good opportunity to fill you in, dear reader, with what I've
been up to. On Thursday, I was off to Fremantle just as I left you. In Freo I
had lovely fresh fish and chips with _thm_ and family. We then visited the
Maritime Museum before heading off to the
tour of Fremantle Prison.

Friday was great. Having done some shopping, we joined a wine-tasting tour,
which visited four different wineries in the Swan Valley, sampling about six
wines, ports and champagnes in each! Needless to say that the rest of Friday is
a bit hazy!

Yesterday was, of course, the highlight of the holiday with the wedding. The
whole day was perfect for _thm_ and his lovely bride, _A_. I look
forward to posting some snaps up here later.

Today was quiet. Just a _long_ stroll along the beach. Well.. I have to
rush off now. I have an appointment with a restaurant and a nice bottle of red
wine, bought at the Sandalford Winery.
