I've decided to return to blogging in 2015 with something I wrote in May 2012.
This was written for a publication of one of my former colleagues, ["Light Bulb
Bites"](https://provensal.com/lbb/).

-----

Light Bulb (or "Globe", as we say in Australia) Bites call on us to be more
creative and more innovative. Oft-times, a developer's first instinct when
faced with a technical problem is to reach for an editor and start putting a
script together to automate a solution.
[Jerome](https://provensal.com/lbb/the-author/) demonstrated this with Days!

In his '[EWD](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/)', 
["On the cruelty of really teaching computing science"](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd10xx/EWD1036.PDF), 
[Edsger Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) wrote:

> [...] if we wish to count lines of code, we should not regard them as "lines
produced" but as "lines spent": the current conventional wisdom is so foolish as
to book that count on the wrong side of the ledger.

This is a real challenge: is my first instinct counter-productive?

In his 2012 Q1 post-earnings address to the firm our President and CEO
highlighted that each of us has to be more productive and that we'll all be
measured on this productivity.

Are calls for us to innovate and create in opposition with the mandate from the
top to be productive? Thankfully not. In [Jeff
Atwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood)'s recent blog post ["Please
Don't Learn to Code"](https://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/)
he reminds us:

> Software developers tend to be software addicts who think their job is to write
code. But it's not. Their job is to solve problems. Don't celebrate the creation
of code, celebrate the creation of solutions. We have way too many coders
addicted to doing just one more line of code already.
 
When we write code, particularly code for an already-solved problem, we are not
really contributing a solution but adding to the problem! Now we have more code
that needs to be tested and maintained. Furthermore it must be understood by the
next developer who has to solve an adjacent problem. 

By creatively reusing an existing solution, not only are we not adding to our
colossal codebase, we're actually saving our company time and effort in testing
and maintaining it for years to come. That is real productivity!

We need to look around us and identify the obstacles that stand between us
productivity. And not just in development or QA: talk to a member of the trading
team or technical support and find out what really slows them down: solve that
problem and award yourself an extra pat on the back if you didn't write a single
line of code to do it.

Solutions are more valuable the more people that they help. If you've come up
with an innovative solution to a problem you or a colleague faced please share
it. In a global company if one person faces a problem it's highly likely that
their counterpart in another office is facing the same problem and would welcome
your solution. This value is multiplied when you consider that your counterpart
in the other office may be working a solution when they could be working on
something else.

> You can be part of the problem, or part of the solution.

and I happen to believe you can be both. The trick is in being just
the latter.
