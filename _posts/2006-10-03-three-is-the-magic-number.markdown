title: Three is the Magic Number
---

Most of yesterday was spent setting up
([virtual](http://www.vmware.com/products/server/))
[Linux](http://www.novell.com/linux/) servers, at work. This reminded me that
some time ago [I published a list of
applications](http://johnsy.com/blog/entry/20051130191827) that I couldn't live
without on a PC. My list for Linux / Unix is much shorter:

1. [Vim](http://vim.org/) (of course)
1. [Zsh](http://zsh.sunsite.dk/)
1. [GNU Screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)
1. [w3m](http://www.w3m.org/)
1. [Mutt](http://www.mutt.org/)

That's about it.

Tuesdays are bass days and I had my third lesson last night. Now that I'm
starting to learn more about music in general, I quite fancy getting another
instrument (probably a keyboard) so that I can play around with it and find out
how it all works. I'm finding scales a _lot_ more interesting than I thought I
would.

I recently signed up for a Ringo account so that I could see some of a cousin's
holiday snaps (and very nice they are, too). Ringo offer a facility (as so many
websites do, these days) to see who else in my address-book has an account. It
turns out that lots of people did (am I the last person on the planet to hear of
this site?). Being a nosey bugger, I pressed the buttons needed to ask my
friends if I could see their photos (and they mine) and had lots of (positive)
responses back within minutes (presumably because you are all nosey buggers and
wanted to see my photos). Amusingly, none of my friends who were on Ringo before
me have uploaded any photographs whatsoever, which is fair enough because
neither have I (except the standard profile one)! I think I shall be sticking
with [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnsyweb/) for the foreseeable
future.
