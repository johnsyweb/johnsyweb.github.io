title: Happy Birthday, Sir Jack!
---

It has been a good day. Not only did I get to watch a very exciting grand prix
from just inside turn five (and without having to get up at ludicrous o'clock),
but I got to meet a racing legend.

Sir Jack Brabham O.B.E. was in the paddock signing autographs next to his
Brabham racing car. Somebody brought him a little chocolate cake as today he
celebrates his eightieth birthday, so we all sang Happy Birthday to him as he
blew out the candles.


If he wished for his countryman to win his home grand prix, he would have been
disappointed, alas. I don't think that would spoil the race for those of you who
are yet to see it. I shall not say too much more on the subject for that reason.


If you have seen the race, or if you don't care but would like to see some
pictures of fast cars, they are now available from [my Flickr
account](http://flickr.com/photos/johnsyweb/sets/72057594094253465/). Enjoy!
