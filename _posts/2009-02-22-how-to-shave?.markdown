title: How to shave?
---

I forget if I mentioned that [I'm taking part in the Leukaemia Foundation
World's Greatest Shave on 14 March
2009](/blog/2009/02/15/please-sponsor-me-in-world's-greatest-shave-2009/), but I
am, so there and I'm looking at [ways to raise more
money](/blog/2009/02/18/wax-on.-wax-off/).


Yesterday [my delightful wife](http://thribble.blogspot.com.au/) asked me if I
was going to just shave at home or if I'm going to have an event to mark the
occasion. To be honest, I'm yet to decide.


Please take a moment to pop over to [my profile
page](http://my.imisfriendraising.com.au/personalPage.aspx?SID=54895) and leave
a message as to how you think I should execute the shave. Perhaps you'd pay good
money to use the clippers?


While you're over at [my profile
page](http://my.imisfriendraising.com.au/personalPage.aspx?SID=54895), I
encourage you to [drop some coins in the collection
tin](https://secure.imisfriendraising.com.au/registrant/donate.aspx?EventID=9529&amp;LangPref=en-CA&amp;SPID=1239819).


Many thanks to all that have already donated and to those still to donate.
