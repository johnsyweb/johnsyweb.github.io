After the delayed blog entry about {% post_url 2001-06-21-blog-entry-for-thu-21-jun-2001-09-21-11-utc %}, I have
finally gotten around to writing a bit about Tokyo
for you. The week was amazing from start to finish. We arrived at Narita Airport at some ungodly hour
of the morning, but were still met by three smiling faces, our old friends
_tk_ and _sa_ & his charming girlfriend. After lots of mutual back
slapping and exchanging of Japanese expletives on our arrival we adjourned for a
quick beverage before setting off for the countryside for the day. _tk_ and
_sa_ had the whole week planned out for us and we are very grateful to them
for that. So off we went in convoy along the toll-infested highways and byways
of Tokyo out to Hakone National
Park where we would spend the rest of the day relaxing in one of the
region's many hot
springs. This was the way to relax after a long flight, chatting with
friends whilst soaking in Jacuzzis, rose baths, green tea baths and even sake baths! That evening we ate out at a lovely
Japanese restaurant before going back to our hotel for some [Japanese beer][asahi] and a civilised game of
cards. Well, semi-civilised... ...there was a lot of burping!

The next day we left the hotel and headed off for Kamakura to see the
town and then on to see the Daibutsu.
That afternoon we headed back to the City where we would spend the rest of our
week. After checking into our hotel we spent some time in Ginza
searching for a bank that would accept my Cirrus card.
Japanese Pancakes were the order of the day to line our stomachs for a few more
tins of Asahi!

On the Tuesday, our Japanese friends had to attend the office (I couldn't bring
myself to type the W-word) leaving _rtm_, _mec_ and I free to go to go
to Tokyo Disneyland
for the day. Hey... I'd never been to Disneyland before and I had a thoroughly
fantastic time. I hope one day to bring my little sister to Disneyland, but
perhaps I'll go to one a bit closer to home.

The rest of the week was fairly relaxing. Apart from catching up with friends
and sampling the local cuisine, the only other touristy thing we engaged in was
an afternoon bus
tour with _ta_.

Our last night in Tokyo was one of the most memorable of the whole trip: a
lovely meal with the guys and their colleagues. Much alcohol was consumed that
night and when the guys suggested sampling some Japanese-style karaoke... it
seemed like a fantastic idea. Photos of me singing many rock classics are
**not** available anywhere on the Internet. Thank goodness!

Once again I would like to thank _tk_ & his father, _sa_ &
_N_ and _ta_ for giving us a wonderful week in Tokyo.
