I forget if I mentioned that [I'm taking part in the Leukaemia Foundation World's Greatest Shave on 14 March 2009][sponsor], but I am, so there, and I'm looking at [ways to raise more money][wax].

Yesterday [my delightful wife][thribble] asked me if I was going to just shave at home or if I'm going to have an event to mark the occasion. To be honest, I'm yet to decide.

Back in 2009 this linked to my personal fundraising page, which no longer exists. If you'd still like to support the cause, please visit the [Leukaemia Foundation][leukaemia] or [World's Greatest Shave][wgs].
