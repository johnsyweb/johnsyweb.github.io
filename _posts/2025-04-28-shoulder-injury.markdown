Yes, my left arm is currently in a sling. Having described why this is multiple times, I thought I'd write it down.

On Thursday morning, while running before work, I tripped and dislocated my shoulder. My caring running partner called an ambulance, and while the paramedics were assessing me, the shoulder joint was relocated with an audible click. After being evaluated at a local hospital, I received an official diagnosis of a chip on my shoulder!

Now, I'm waiting on appointments with an orthopaedic specialist and a physiotherapist. I hope to be out of the sling in the next couple of weeks. Despite the injury, I'm pain-free, though mildly frustrated with the limitations on my mobility.

Fortunately, I'm right-handed, which means I can do most of my daily activities unencumbered. The main lesson learned is the importance of being more careful about foot placement while running. While it's an inconvenience, I'm staying positive and focused on my recovery.

## Update on Tuesday, 2025-05-06

I went to the fracture clinic this morning and saw the upper limb surgeon (and learned that such a specialism exists). There was some good news! I don't need surgery at this stage. My muscles and tendons haven't sustained any noticeable damage. Unfortunately, despite being largely pain-free, I remain strictly sling-bound 24 hours per day until six weeks post-incident to allow the socket to fully heal. No driving, running, or physiotherapy for me, which is frustrating as I don't like to rely on others for day-to-day tasks. I'll be back to the clinic on 3 June for imaging. Fingers crossed.

## Sling: slung! On Tuesday, 2025-06-03

I cannot express what a relief it is to be told that the shoulder socket has healed sufficiently that I can dispose of the sling that I have been wearing since the end of April!

The surgeon was satisfied that no surgery would be required and I can resume most daily tasks straightaway, while undertaking a couple of regular rehabilitational exercises to regain mobility of that particular joint.
