Yes, my left arm is currently in a sling. Having described why this is multiple times, I thought I'd write it down.

On Thursday morning, while running before work, I tripped and dislocated my shoulder. My caring running partner called an ambulance, and while the paramedics were assessing me, the shoulder joint was relocated with an audible click. After being evaluated at a local hospital, I received an official diagnosis of a chip on my shoulder!

Now, I'm waiting on appointments with an orthopaedic specialist and a physiotherapist. I hope to be out of the sling in the next couple of weeks. Despite the injury, I'm pain-free, though mildly frustrated with the limitations on my mobility.

Fortunately, I'm right-handed, which means I can do most of my daily activities unencumbered. The main lesson learned is the importance of being more careful about foot placement while running. While it's an inconvenience, I'm staying positive and focused on my recovery.
