title: "$500 Target reached, $1000 for the wax!"

I don't like sending out emails to large lists of people, but sometimes needs
must and yesterday I sent out two mass emails to people in order to gain more
sponsorship monies for [the Leukaemia Foundation][leukaemia].

Those emails are clearly paying off. Rather generously, you have taken my total
past the $500 target and ~~two~~ three things must now happen.
One, when the time comes I must shave my legs as well as my
[bonce][bonce]. Two, I have to
raise my fundraising target. Three, I have to provide you with some incentive to
keep giving. Five, you must continue to sponsor me!

It is with great trepidation that I announce that if _you_ help me raise $1000,
_I_ shall answer your repeated calls to not only shave my legs, but wax them
too. What have I let myself in for?

So please now show your support by leaving words of encouragement, advice on how to wax(!) and most
importantly a donation to [the Leukaemia Foundation][leukaemia].
Every single dollar counts. Once you have done this, please pass on the message
to one friend or family member.

Deep thanks to all of you.
