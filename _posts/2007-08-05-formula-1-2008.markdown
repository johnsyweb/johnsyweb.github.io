According to [Australian Grand Prix][grandprix], there are (only) 220 days to go until
the we can hear the sound of [Formula 1][f1] cars
screaming around [Albert Park Lake][albert-park]
(a short stroll away from here) once more. And this year the V8 supercars are
back. I, for one, am very excited about that!

This season, despite the controversies (not least this weekend's debacle in the
Maclaren pit), has been very exciting to watch and I expect that the rivalries
will be even more fierce next season. I should certainly like to be there for my
third(!) Melbourne Grand Prix.

I had heard that Bahrain was going to be the first race of the season, but
according to the official website, [The Australian Grand Prix will kick off
proceedings on 16 March][2008-season], so we will get
to see the new cars first again!

Anyway, the point of this post is that there was a note in our PO Box from the
organisers of the [Grand Prix][grandprix] telling us that we could get the same tickets as we
had last year at a reduced price if we book before the end of this month. I'm
sure my father-in-law would vouch that the Four Corner Grandstand
option worked out very
nicely for us in 2007. I don't really want to go by myself, so I thought I'd see
if any of you guys fancied joining me. I can't offer free tickets, but I can
offer free accommodation on a first-come-first-served basis!
