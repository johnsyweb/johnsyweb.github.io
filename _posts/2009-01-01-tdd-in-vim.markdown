title: TDD in Vim
---



Happy new year, folks!


Here's a little utility I knocked together yesterday to decrease the number of
key-presses needed to switch between unit test and production code:



[toggle_unit_tests : plug-in for toggling between source and unit test files
](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2500)



I've tested it with C++ and Python and it works nicely, but should work well
with other languages too.



If you find yourself doing TDD in Python using Vim, you may find the following
page useful:



[Integration with PyUnit testing
framework](https://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Integration_with_PyUnit_testing_framework).



That is all.
