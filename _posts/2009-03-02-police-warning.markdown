I've just received the following SMS:

> Msg from Vic Police:Extreme weather in Vic expected Mon night and Tues.High
wind &amp; fire risk.Listen to local ABC Radio for emergency updates.Do not
reply to this

According to [The
Age](http://www.theage.com.au/national/were-not-crying-wolf--fires-high-winds-to-hit-state-tonight-20090302-8lmx.html?page=-1),
another two million similar messages will be sent.


Speaking of The Police, I recommend this [Mashup of _Watching the Detectives +
Walking on the Moon_](http://www.ilike.com/artist/The+Police/videos/253583054).


Stay safe.
