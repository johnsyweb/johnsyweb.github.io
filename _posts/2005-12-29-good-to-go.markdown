Our work here in Perth is just about complete. This morning in
<a href="http://www.bgpa.wa.gov.au/">Kings Park</a> we photographed our
first
<a href="http://www.bigthings.com.au/">Big Thing</a>: The
<a href="http://www.bigthings.com.au/s.htm#stair">Staircase</a>.


Meanwhile, The Beast was at the doctor's for a health-check ahead of its own
big thing, our road trip across this great and vast land. Today, I decided
to name the trip _The Beast on the Road Tour_, after, well, a 1982
tour by one of the bands that I have been known to be interested in. The
doctor's bill was considerable, but not quite $666, but at least now we can
claim _Piece of Mind_ (and four new tyres, a new battery and a
healthier braking system).


In other news, our bank cards are now in our possession, which makes paying
for things, such as car repairs far easier.


That's about all the news that I have for now. Expect more in the New Year.


Be excellent to each other and party on!
