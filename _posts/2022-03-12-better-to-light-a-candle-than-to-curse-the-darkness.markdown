title: Better to Light a Candle Than to Curse the Darkness

I've been enjoying [Tim Ferris'](https://tim.blog/) [5-Bullet
Friday](https://go.tim.blog/5-bullet-friday-1/) newsletter for the past couple
of years (thanks to [Jacob](https://jacobbednarz.com/) for the introduction).
Most weeks this newsletter includes a _Quote Iâ€™m pondering_ (this week's didn't,
just because I was thinking about it).

So here's a quotation that I've been mulling over recently:

> But denunciatory rhetoric is so much easier and cheaper than good works, and
> proves a popular temptation. Yet is it far better to light the candle than to
> curse the darkness.
