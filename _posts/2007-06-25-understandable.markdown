One of my favourite sections of [I'm Sorry I Haven't a
Clue](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/clue.shtml) is the [Uxbridge English
Dictionary](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Uxbridge-English-Dictionary-Sorry-Havent/dp/0007203373),
where contestants suggest new meanings for old words.


Not having the book I can't tell you if the definition I came up with this
morning has already been done, but nevertheless I thought I'd share it with the
<em>paj</em>Log audience (that's you, folks!).

> _Understandable (adjective)_: a shower spraying water that is neither
too hot nor too cold.
