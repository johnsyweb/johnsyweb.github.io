title: I'm riding 496 km...

Inspired and encouraged by my good friend [Ross], I have signed up for the [2025 Great Cycle Challenge] and will be riding this October to fight kids' cancer! In the same month as running [Melbourne Marathon], because I don't like to do things by halves.

<!-- more -->

My goal is to pedal 496 km throughout the month. Why 496? I've not ridden my bicycle much since [my last cycling commute], so I figured I would build up gradually. 1km on the first of October, 2km on the second, and so on, up until the end of the month.

Why am I doing this? Because cancer is the largest killer of children from disease in Australia: three children die of cancer every week. We all know somebody who has had to deal with this pernicious disease.

My challenge will be tough, but it's nothing compared to what these brave kids and their families face every day of their lives as they battle this terrible disease.

**Kids should be living life, NOT fighting for it.**

That’s why I’m taking on this challenge to end childhood cancer and save young lives.

Please support me by making a donation through [my 2025 Great Cycle Challenge fundraising page].

All funds raised will support [Children's Medical Research Institute] to continue their work to develop innovative treatments and find a cure for childhood cancer.

_Thank you for your support._
