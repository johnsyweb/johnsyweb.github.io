title: What a victory!
---


We were up at 5 o'clock this morning so that we could witness a great sporting
event. Today was Victoria's _other_ grand prix, the [Moto
GP](https://bikes.grandprix.com.au/) down on [Phillip
Island](https://www.phillipislandcircuit.com.au/).


Having been to quite a number of motor sport events, this was actually my first
trip to see two-wheelers fighting it out on the tarmac and I have to say that it
was really very enjoyable indeed.


Starting from third on the grid, it was excellent to see [(Australia's) Casey
Stoner](https://www.caseystoner.com.au/) in the last as he passed us into Turn 1.
Stoner retained the lead from there to the chequered flag but there were some
great battles going on behind him. Very exciting to watch. It was great to see
the World champion
[win](https://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/10/14/2059138.htm) on his home
soil.


The circuit itself is one of the nicest I have been at; even with general
admission tickets, we could see the majority of the track from the grass
opposite the pit exit. The fact that the sun shone all day form about 10am
really helped matters. It was pretty parky when we arrived there, I can tell
you.


Now I'm (really) looking forward to the Formula 1.
