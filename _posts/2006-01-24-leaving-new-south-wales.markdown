title: Leaving New South Wales

> &quot;We are about to re-enter the Zone of Unpredictable Connectivity&quot;

...wrote [Plurp](http://www.stevewhite.org/log/current/), which pretty much sums
up what we are doing today.


Today we leave Sydney for Orange, where we'll celebrate Australia Day, before
continuing on our journey and our quest for [Big
Things](http://www.flickr.com/groups/australianbigthings/).


Doesn't time fly when you're having fun, exploring cities, visiting friends and
family, [barbecuing in a pub](http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnsyweb/90792999/)
and all that jazz?


We hope not to be In The Zone for quite as long as Plurp has been. Keep your
[RSS Reader](http://www.rssowl.org/), tuned, folks.
