In January of this year, I joined the [parkrun Australia](https://www.parkrun.com.au/)
Event Ambassador programme and I'm finding it's a great way to give something
back to this great community as well as sharing the experience I gained as
founding Event Director of
[Coburg parkrun](https://blog.parkrun.com/au/2019/07/16/parkrun-profile-coburg/)
with other event teams. It's also a great excuse to visit parkrun events besides
my home event, which is a short jog from home.

I'm also working with a passionate pair of parkrunners who are looking to
establish a parkrun a short jog from their own home in Epping North, near
Wallert, in Melbourne's North. This event is very close to being fully-funded
and has recently secured a a base grant of $1,000 to go towards the start-up
costs.

We are looking to launch this event soon and it will be one of over 360 parkruns
in Australia to provide a free, timed, 5km running/walking event to the local
community, every Saturday morning.

The overarching goal of establishing a parkrun event is to encourage the health
and wellbeing of community members. The project aims to engage people from all
backgrounds and of all fitness levels, abilities and ages, both to volunteer and
participate.

We are looking to raise the funds now to purchase an Automatic Electronic
Defibrillator (AED) in order to create the safest possible environment for our
community to get together.

Could you please help us to secure this essential funding? To vote for our event
go to [The Aurora Seedling Fund](/bit.ly/vote4ap) and click the "vote"
under our event or (if you're nearby) head over to [Sprout Hub
Aurora](https://aurora.sprouthub.com.au/) and grab a coffee, with every purchase
you get a bean to put in the voting box of your choice!

Then share this link with your friends :-)

Deep thanks.
