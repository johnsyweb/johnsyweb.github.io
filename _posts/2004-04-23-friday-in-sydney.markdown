title: Friday in Sydney
---

The ferry journey from nearby Parramatta to Cirular Quay, at the heart of New
South Wales was wonderful. It doesn't matter how many different angles I see
the Sydney, the Opera House or Harbour Bridge from, I still look on it and
think, &quot;wow!&quot;


Today was a fairly relaxed day. We mooched around, taking in the sights that
Sydney has to offer, at our own pace. First stop was Darling Harbour, in the
blazing sun. From there we took the monorail to Pitt Street and meandered down
through Hyde Park to Saint Mary's Cathedral. The colourful King's Cross was
our next stop, taking in the views of the hotel that I stayed in last time:
it's surrounded in netting as a conversion is underway. Next time we visit
Sydney, it will be a luxurious apartment block!


On our way back to the train, we wandered through Woollamooloo. No sign of a
university there, alas, never mind a Bruce-infested philosophy department.
Bugger!


It's now dark (these sunsets don't last long), which means that it's Friday
night. Time for me to put the laptop to bed, methinks!
