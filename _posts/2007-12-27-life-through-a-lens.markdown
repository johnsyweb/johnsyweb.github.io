title: Life Through a Lens

Those who follow [My Flickr Feed](http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnsyweb/) are
probably bored to tears of sunset shots by now. To them I can only apologise as
there are some more uploading as I type this.


The difference between the previous shots and today's is the equipment due to
the fact that I was playing with my new toy. For those interested in such
things, my new camera is a [Samsung
DX-10](http://www.samsungcamera.com/product/pro_view.asp?cat_uid=62&amp;prol_uid=1923)
(which is essentially a [Pentax
K10D](http://www.pentax.com.au/pentax/index.cfm?pageID=7&amp;modelID=1&amp;pageREF=&amp;)
with the word ['Pentax' crossed out and 'Samsung' written in in
crayon](http://reviews.cnet.com/4326-6501_7-6563379-1.html)). I went for the
Samsung over the Pentax as I got [a better
lens](http://www.samsungcamera.com/product/pro_acc_view.asp?prol_uid=1338&amp;cat_uid=13&amp;sac_gid=1)
bundled in with it than I would have with the Pentax. I also invested in a
telephoto lens (the [Sigma 70-300mm F4-5.6 APO DG
Macro](http://www.sigmaphoto.com/lenses/lenses_all_details.asp?id=3303&amp;navigator=3),
for the geeks). So this is what I was using this evening when I took [these
photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnsyweb/archives/date-posted/2007/12/27/).


Obviously I need to hone my photographic skills, but Melbourne presents many
opportunities for practice, so I should be able to take some decent snaps at
next year's Grand Prix.
