Those who follow [my Flickr feed][flickr-feed] are
probably bored to tears of sunset shots by now. To them I can only apologise as
there are some more uploading as I type this.

The difference between the previous shots and today's is the equipment due to
the fact that I was playing with my new toy. For those interested in such
things, my new camera is a [Samsung DX-10][samsung-dx10]
(which is essentially a [Pentax K10D][pentax-k10d]
with the word "Pentax" crossed out and "Samsung" written in in
crayon, as [humorously noted in this review][k10d-cnet]). I went for the
Samsung over the Pentax as I got a better
lens bundled in with it than I would have with the Pentax. I also invested in a
telephoto lens (the Sigma 70-300mm F4-5.6 APO DG
Macro, for the geeks). So this is what I was using this evening when I took [photos from that day][flickr-2007-12-27].

Obviously I need to hone my photographic skills, but Melbourne presents many
opportunities for practice, so I should be able to take some decent snaps at
next year's Grand Prix.
