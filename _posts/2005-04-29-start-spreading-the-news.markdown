Oooh! I have finally got around to looking at a link that _K_ sent me last week
to the website of a new Disney film: [The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the
Witch and the Wardrobe][narnia]. According to [IMDB][narnia-imdb], the film will be
released in time for Christmas.

After a brief wander around the website, I'm now off to find a copy of the book
to include in my hand luggage for tonight's flight.

The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was one of my favourite books as a young
boy, along with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Oddly, I have no real desire
to see [that particular film][charlie], which means that [Kris][kris] will love it!

Well, I have a few things to do before we head off to see The Whalleys in New
York, so I shall bid you all adieu. Adieu!
