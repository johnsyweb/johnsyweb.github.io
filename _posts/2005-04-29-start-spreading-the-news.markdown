Oooh! I have finally got around to looking at a link that _K_ sent me last week
to the website of a new Disney film: [The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the
Witch and the Wardrobe](https://disney.go.com/disneypictures/narnia/). According
to [IMDB](https://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0363771/releaseinfo), the film will be
released in time for Christmas.


After a brief wander around the website, I'm now off to find a copy of the book
to include in my hand luggage for tonight's flight.


The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was one of my favourite books as a young
boy, along with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Oddly, I have no real desire
to see [that particular film](https://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0367594/), which means
that [Kris](https://cafe.jenkster.com/) will love it!


Well, I have a few things to do before we head off to see The Whalleys in New
York, so I shall bid you all adieu. Adieu!
