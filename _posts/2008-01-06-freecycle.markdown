I'm sure I have mentioned Freecycling before. It's a fantastic way to prevent
perfectly usable items from ending up in landfill before their time has come.
Today we had a bit of a clear-out and put a few items on our local
[Freecycle](https://www.freecycle.org/) group and now they have gone. Brilliant!


Thus I'd like to recommend [Freecycling](https://www.freecycle.org/) to you all.
I offer you a top tip if you are advertising something such as a digital camera
or a laptop or something else that generates a lot of requests. Once you have a
single taker for your item and then send a 'Taken' message back to the list and
then delete your original message (using the [Yahoo!
Groups](https://groups.yahoo.com/) page). This should prevent you receiving
countless emails long after your item has been taken. We've started doing this
ever since _K_ got an email over a year after advertising some things on the
Crawley group.


That was all.
