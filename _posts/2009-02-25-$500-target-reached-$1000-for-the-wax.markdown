title: "$500 Target reached, $1000 for the wax!"
---


I don't like sending out emails to large lists of people, but sometimes needs
must and yesterday I sent out two mass emails to people in order to gain more
sponsorship monies for [the Leukaemia Foundation](https://www.leukaemia.org.au/).


Those emails are clearly paying off. Rather generously, you have taken my total
past the $500 target and <del>two</del> <ins>three</ins> things must now happen.
One, when the time comes I must shave my legs as well as my
[bonce](https://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=bonce). Two, I have to
raise my fundraising target. Three, I have to provide you with some incentive to
keep giving. Five, you must continue to [sponsor
me](https://secure.imisfriendraising.com.au/registrant/donate.aspx?EventID=9529&amp;LangPref=en-CA&amp;SPID=1239819)!


It is with great trepidation that I announce that if _you_ help me raise $1000,
_I_ shall answer your repeated calls to not only shave my legs, but wax them
too. What have I let myself in for?


So please now pop by [my profile
page](https://my.imisfriendraising.com.au/personalPage.aspx?SID=54895) and show
your support by leaving words of encouragement, advice on how to wax(!) and most
importantly [a
donation](https://secure.imisfriendraising.com.au/registrant/donate.aspx?EventID=9529&amp;LangPref=en-CA&amp;SPID=1239819).
Every single dollar counts. Once you have done this, please pass on the message
to one friend or family member.


Deep thanks to all of you.
