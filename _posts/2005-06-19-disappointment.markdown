title: Disappointment
---

I've just watched what could be described as the [US Formula 1 Grand
Prix](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4109148.stm) but
would be more accurately be described as a farce.


Having just ordered tickets in the last week to go to my first Grand Prix, my
heart sank as I watched fourteen of the twenty cars peel into the pit lane at
the end of the parade lap. The situation in Indianapolis was entirely avoidable.


However, as sympathetic as I am to the fans' bitter disappointment, there really
was no excuse for the abuse that the remaining six drivers received. I don't
know whether I would have remained seated to watch the 'race', but the guys out
on the track on the day were not the ones at fault. I felt sorry for them;
particularly [Tiago Monteiro](http://www.tiagoracing.com/), who gained his first
Formula 1 podium, but couldn't really celebrate it.


Very sad.
