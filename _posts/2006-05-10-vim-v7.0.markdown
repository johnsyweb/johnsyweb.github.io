title: Vim v7.0
---


After some years of development, [Bram Moolenaar](https://www.moolenaar.net/) has
[released](https://groups.yahoo.com/group/vimannounce/message/161) version seven
of [Vim](https://www.vim.org/). I've been beta-testing it for a while now and
recommend upgrading to the new version as soon as you can!


I've updated my
[Primitive](https://www.johnsy.org/dotfiles/.vim/colors/primitive.vim)
colour-scheme (should anyone want to use it). I need to do some work on my
[.vimrc](https://www.johnsy.org/dotfiles/.vimrc) script (which started off life
as [gjvc](https://www.gjvc.com/)'s .vimrc) to iron out a couple of niggles, but
you're more than welcome to use it.


If you like using Vim (or if you just want to help out the kids in
[Uganda](https://iccf-holland.org/)), you can [sponsor
Vim](https://www.vim.org/sponsor/). Now that Bram's got himself a job, all of the
money goes to charity!
