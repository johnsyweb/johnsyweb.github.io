After some years of development, [Bram Moolenaar][1] has [released][2] version seven of [Vim][3]. I've been beta-testing it for a while now and recommend upgrading to the new version as soon as you can!

I've updated my [Primitive][4] colour-scheme (should anyone want to use it). I need to do some work on my [.vimrc][5] script (which started off life as [gjvc][6]'s .vimrc) to iron out a couple of niggles, but you're more than welcome to use it.

If you like using Vim (or if you just want to help out the kids in [Uganda][7]), you can [sponsor Vim][8]. Now that Bram's got himself a job, all of the money goes to charity!
