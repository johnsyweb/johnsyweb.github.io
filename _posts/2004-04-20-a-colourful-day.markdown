title: A colourful day

A brief pause in the day in between visiting the breathtakingly magnificent
Blue Mountains and heading into Sydney for an evening meal provides me with
the opportunity to record a word or two!


_N_ will be back from the office shortly, then we will be off out for
the evening. _M_'s office is the back room of his in-laws' house. He
has been telecommuting to Horsham (West Sussex), since he moved back from
England, last year!


The barefoot author sits in the evening cool on the patio of _N_'s
parents'  house, the site of last night's fantastic barbecue: steaks and
prawns, mushrooms and hash browns. We also had some lovely smoked mullet,
fresh salad  and the finest home-brewed beer I have ever tasted, as we caught
up with _M_ and _N_. We are surrounded by fruit trees and vines.
I can see lemons, oranges, grapefruit and grapes growing in green-fingered
_B_'s garden.


Australian hospitality really is overwhelmingly good! In Perth, we were
provided with lovely accommodation, tasty meals, superb day-trips and, of
course, fine company. Our time in New South Wales looks like being every bit
as good, it has to be said.


_B_ and _M_ (_N_'s parents for those not in the know),
not only make fine home brews and a comfortable guest room, but also ensure
that their guests get a personal guided tour of the Blue Mountains. The
scenery at 1000m, above the eucalyptus and gum trees, is absolutely awesome.


On our tour of the Blue Mountains, we visited the towns of Katoomba,
Blackheath and Lithgow. Wonderfully peaceful towns with views that would make
it so easy to get up in the morning. We saw scenic railway lines and orchard
after orchard. We really are in a fruit-growing region, here.
