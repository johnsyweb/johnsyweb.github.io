From the television coverage, this afternoon, it looks like a beautiful day in
the Loire Valley. Just under an hour ago, now, a large number of particularly
fast four-wheeled machines started speeding their way around one of the
greatest and most celebrated circuits in the world:
<a href="https://www.lemans.org/">Le Mans</a>.


Twelve short months ago, I was there watching the famous 24-hour race with
some of my friends and family. Watching the start of today's race from the
sofa convinced me that I shall be there again next year. It's a bug, I tell
you. Once you have been there once and experienced the wonders of watching
some of the World's finest drivers doing battle on the track in the glorious
beasts that compete at Le Mans, you just _have_ to go back for more.
It's not just the race, though, dear reader. Oh no! The whole ambience of Le
Mans is indescribable. Hundreds and hundreds of motorsports enthusiasts all
gathered together, ogling each others' cars. Egging drivers to do burn-outs in
their cars as they pass by. And just general good spirit. Oh yes! I shall
return.


Today, though, I have been setting up webcams and microphones to facilitate
transatlantic marital communications over the forty-something days and nights
ahead.


Tomorrow, as Mrs Johns is curled up on the aeroplane with a good book, I shall
be curled up on the sofa watching the end of the aforementioned endurance
race, followed by the <a href="https://www.grandprix.ca/">Canadian Grand
Prix</a>.


Meep meep.
