title: Memories of Sydney, NSW
---

I guess that It's time I wrote some stuff about Sydney, given that I left there
nearly a fortnight ago and that the nice guys at <a
href="http://www.fotango.com/">Fotango</a> have sent me my (digital) pictures
already (<a href="mailto:blogholidaysnaps@johnsy.org">email me</a> for details
on how to see them).

So. Where to start? The first evening was pretty uneventful, we landed, caught
the bus to our <a href="http://www.gazebohotels.com.au/">hotel</a> (which we got
    at a <i>bargain</i> price from <a
        href="http://www.wotif.com/">wotif.com</a>), had some dinner and took in
        some of the views of the <a
            href="http://www.kingscross.nsw.gov.au/">Kings Cross</a> area of
        Sydney.

On the Tuesday, we ventured out towards Sydney Harbour. Sydney Harbour is quite
possibly the most beautiful natural harbour in the world. It's absolutely
massive with many bays, inlets and of course has a stunning bridge (which you
can <a href="http://www.bridgeclimb.com/">climb</a>, if you shell out enough
cash) and, of course, the World-famous Opera House. We spent much of the day
wandering around Circular Quay and The Rocks. We also climbed the 200 steps to
the Sydney Harbour Bridge Pylon Museum &amp; Lookout, which provided fantastic
views of the Harbour. In the evening, we caught up with some old friends, who
work on George Street, for some long-overdue beers!

The AMP Tower was our target for the next day. Standing 305m tall above the
City, the Tower (the tallest in Australia, I believe) gives breathtaking views
for miles around! Once we'd taken in as much viewage (yes, I made that word
up) as we could handle, we headed over to Darling Harbour and then off
to see the <a href="http://www.buran.com.au/">Buran Space
    Shuttle</a>, which is being exhibited there at the moment.

For me though, the highlight of our time in NSW was a day trip to The Blue
Mountains. That place was truly awesome National Park land, the size of Belgium
with some of the worlds finest scenery. I went on the World's Steepest Scenic
Railway, saw The Three Sisters and was taught how to fly a boomerang!

Well... I'm sure I could write lots more about Sydney, about the fantastic food
that's on offer there, Chinatown and all the rest of it, but the best way to
find out what it's like is to go there! It's a wonderful city!
