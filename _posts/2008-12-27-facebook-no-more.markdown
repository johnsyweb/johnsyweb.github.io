title: Facebook No More!
---




I've deleted my Facebook account. Hip, hip, hooray!


Having never much liked Facebook, it bugged me that it still occupied far too
many minutes of my days. I complain too much these days that I don't have enough
time to do this and that, so spending fewer minutes declining invitations to
install applications letting me know who thinks I'd make a good rock star should
mean that I can spend more minutes of my day playing bass. Makes sense, doesn't
it?


I appreciate that it's a good method for some people to stay in touch, but there
are many better (and in my opinion, more appropriate) ways to do this and they
work for me, thank you very much.


Here's a YouTube video that highlights some of my many pet hates about Facebook.
