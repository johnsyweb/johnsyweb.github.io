In my last blog post, [Keeping in the Development
Loop](/blog/2022/08/04/keeping-in-the-development-loop/), I listed a bunch of
email newsletters that I enjoy as a technologist. Today I want to share one more
email newsletter that I get a lot of value out of and that's [Better Allies
&reg;](https://betterallies.com/more-content/). Each Friday (ish, depending on
your timezone), Karen Catlin shares five tips on inclusion, from which I think
have learned a lot. I'll let my colleagues be the judges.

Since reading [5 Ally Actions - Apr 9,
2021](https://us19.campaign-archive.com/?u=cc808df089bf312fc1a37916d&id=81fee06c2b)
I have been including my pronouns and the pronunciation of my name in my email
signature. It took less time than it took to read that week's newsletter to add
these. Easy!

Three months ago, I started a new job and on my first day I found myself setting
up new email signatures, Slack and Zoom profiles - each of these includes my
pronouns and the pronunciation of my name, it's just what I do these days. I was
quite surprised to see that this practice is not commonplace in my new workplace
but I expect this will improve.

I was recently in a webinar where a participant was misgendered by one of the
presenters answering their question, which they asked using
[Slido](https://www.slido.com/) (whose homepage boasts, "Itâ€™s how you **include
everyone** in your meetings"). There's currently no facility in Slido to display
pronouns or pronunciation alongside your name. I think this could have saved
some discomfort if it were available and used -- so I've submitted a support
request to add this feature.

People tend to get my pronouns right all of the time and pronounce my name
correctly most of the time, so I'm sure some people are reading this and
wondering why I do this. In short, I want to help to normalise the practice of
sharing pronouns as I understand this is helpful to genderfluid, transgender,
and nonbinary folks. I also believe that no one should have to hear a broken
version of their name. Kudos to [NameDrop](https://namedrop.io/) for making this
really easy.

This week (13 - 19 November) is [Trans Awareness
Week](https://www.minus18.org.au/campaigns/trans-awareness-week), a week to
celebrate, support, and learn about trans and gender diverse people. In the
spirit of being a better ally, here are my 5 action items for this week that you
may like to consider:

1. Subscribe to the ["5 Ally Actions" Newsletter](https://betterallies.us19.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=cc808df089bf312fc1a37916d&id=575137cdc6).
1. Add your
   [pronouns](https://www.minus18.org.au/campaigns/trans-awareness-week) to your
   email signature and online profiles. I've just added mine to this page!
1. If you administer a Slack workplace, [enable "Pronouns
   Display"](https://slack.com/help/articles/1500011115781). By default, the
   pronoun field is hidden in Slack profiles, I learned this week.
1. If you're maintaining a service that connects people, make it possible and
   easy to display pronouns and name pronunciation (and perhaps a recording).
1. [Customise your chatbot to look for problematic terms and suggest alternatives](https://betterallies.com/language/).
