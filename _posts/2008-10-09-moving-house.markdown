Life is in boxes; about fifty boxes of purest cardboard. The removalists came
this morning and in three hours the lovely apartment in which we have lived for
the past year and a bit was a warehouse.

Tomorrow we move 18km (11 miles) across Melbourne to take up residence in our
new house, which will be, I think, my nineteenth &quot;permanent&quot; address
since I was born. It will be great to live in a house again, having lived in
apartments since we moved to Melbourne in February 2006. I shall miss the
terrific view that we have enjoyed from the tenth storey since moving in though.
It really is glorious particularly on sunny days such as today.


Now we have mortgages in both of hemispheres, which seems terribly grown-up. I
don't _feel_ terribly grown-up, not even just passed my 2<sup>5</sup>th
birthday.


The good news for those of you who are fed up with updating your address books
each time that I move home is that the Post Office Box address, which you've had
since we landed in Melbourne remains valid. You can thank me later.


The bad news for those of you who like to keep in contact via electronic means,
such as [Skype](https://share.skype.com/in/102/149282) or (the other
multitudinous instant mithering and social networks to which I am connected) is
that it shall be a little while before we have broadband connected in the new
abode. I shall sporadically check my email on the
[iPhone](https://www.apple.com/au/iphone/), of course. I may even
[tweet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter), who knows.


But first, we must celebrate [_K_](https://thribble.blogspot.com/)'s birthday.
Just think of all of the presents (read: &quot;boxes&quot;) she'll get to unwrap
tomorrow. Aren't you jealous?
