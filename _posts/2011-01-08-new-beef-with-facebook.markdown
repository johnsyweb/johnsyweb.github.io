Yesterday morning I had an email from [Facebook][fb] letting me know that a friend had tagged me on his profile. This sounded fair enough, we're friends after all. It went on to say that he tagged me under "University" with the name of my _alma mater_.

Curious, I logged into the website and saw the name of my former university _on my profile_! When [I signed back up for Facebook][my-fb], I deliberately withheld this information and now it's on my profile.

## But he tagged me on _his_ profile, you said!

Details of which university I attended, the years I was there, my course and grades are all available elsewhere on the Internet; it's not a secret! But having deliberately chosen not to put this information into Mark Zuckerberg's databases, it's infuriating that _anybody_ can enter this information on my behalf and without my permission.

This morning I had a play around with Facebook, adding [MI6][mi6], [CONTROL][control] and [St Trinian's School][st-trinians] to friends's profiles. It's remarkably easy.

Some financial institutions use the name of people's first school and similar information as answers to security questions. It's a huge concern that these answers can be disclosed, unwittingly, by our friends.

Although I was able to remove the information from my profile, I've searched through Facebook's privacy settings, and I can see no way to prevent this information being disclosed, in the first place. I see this as a huge security risk.

If you're a Facebook user (and the chances are very high that you are), please take a moment to review the information you disclose and also your privacy settings. [Sophos's recommendations for Facebook settings][sophos-fb] are a good guideline.
