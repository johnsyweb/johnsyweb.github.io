According to the clock on the laptop, it's nearly four o'clock in the morning.
Oddly enough, it was at half-past four when the alarm went off this morning.
Now we have to start convincing our bodies that the clock on the laptop is
correct, despite the fact that the sun is shining through the aeroplane
window. This afternoon we shall be landing in London, marking the end of our
holidays. If the first three quarters of an hour of this flight are anything
to go by, I shall have bruises all over my coccyx, as the diminutive lady
behind me seems to have very hard and very active knees.


The PA (which keeps interrupting the comedy channel, to which I am trying to
listen and now interrupting this blog entry) informs me that it is now
lunchtime. I guess it _is_ noon in the city from where we departed.


The flight is also pretty turbulent. I guess the chances of me sleeping, in
order that I may help my body adjust to British Summer Time are slim. If you
happen to see me this Bank Holiday weekend, then I apologise in advance if I
am cranky.


The PA has just interrupted again, in at least two different languages, Jasper
Carrott doesn't sound as funny when you can only hear the punchlines. The
caption on my wife's screen tells her that the entertainment has been paused,
while there's an announcement in another part of the cabin. She does not get
to hear the announcement, alas.


I cannot believe that three whole weeks have past since the two of us were
sitting in the departure lounge of London Heathrow Airport, the entire trip
ahead of us. In no time at all we'll be at home, opening little brown window
envelopes, sorting laundry and contemplating going back to work. Not to say
I'm not looking forward to being back home, mark you. It will be good to be
back in our own bed, in charge of our own diets and back in the old routine. I
haven't swum in what seems like an eternity. I'm very much looking forward to
getting back in the pool. I also have bought plenty of bits and pieces
containing electronic circuitry, so I'm looking forward to playing with those
on our return!


So... what have we been up to since I last wrote?


I cut my last blog entry short, and I've lost my train of thought, now, so
we'll call that complete, shall we?

_tk_ arrived home from the office and took us to to a local _izakaya_, a kind of
Japanese pub, that sells food. These places are often frequented by the office
workers of the city, where they socialise and generally chew the fat. Our host
chose a selection of dishes for us, and we got stuck into a few glasses of the
wonderful brews that Japan has to offer. The food was superb. Later, _S_ joined
us. He had been working late, as per usual. Having all caught up on the day's
events, consumed a fine repast and a few ales, we made our way to the local
karaoke bar. Alas, Wednesday evening marked the start of Golden Week, a national
holiday, so the rooms were all full. _K_ didn't get a chance to experience true
Japanese &quot;empty orchestra&quot; on this visit, so there's another excuse
for us to return soon.


On Thursday, we made our way to Hayama. _tk_ and _S_'s employer has a flat there
that is available to employees for a nominal fee. A very nice flat, it is too.
It is right on the coast and, we were delighted to discover, provides a
wonderful view, across the water, of the gloriously snow-capped Mount Fuji.


We spent the afternoon on the beach with our friends, _S_'s boss, associated
wife and two cute daughters. Said Japanese girls, aged six and nine, entertained
us, later in the day, with their knowledge of English nursery rhymes. On the
beach we set up a pair of barbecues and a pair of picnic tables and proceeded to
cook and eat a scrumptious assortment of all manner of meat and seafood;
accompanied, of course, by plenty of _Biru_.


Our last full day in Japan was spent in the historic city of Kamakura, not far
from Hayama. I had been there once before, in June 2001 and recall how much I
enjoyed my time there. This visit was no different. The enormous temples and
gigantic _Daibutsu_ that you see in Kamakura are unlike anything I have seen
anywhere else in the World. I'm sure when I eventually get to visit other parts
of Japan, I shall be equally impressed by the sights available.


Last night, we were treated to a top-notch Chinese meal, in the company of
_tk_'s father. Following on from the restaurant where the Webb-Ellis Cup-winning
England side ate in Sydney, the restaurant in question was where 2002's Football
World Cup-winning Brazilian team dined. We ate a whole host of oriental dishes,
including shark's fin soup and crab's claw, which neither my wife nor I had
eaten before; both of which were delicious!


Sadly, our trip draws to a close. I may write some more about it in the days and
weeks to come, depending on how they pan out. Right, now though, I'm going to
attempt to get a few hours' sleep.


To the three families who so generously provided us with accommodation and who
gave up so much of your own time to entertain and educate my wife and I over the
past three weeks, I just want to say, once more how grateful we are. We look
forward to welcoming you at an English airport in the not-too-distant future and
returning the favour! Thank you.
