Sometimes my add-ons in [Firefox](https://mozilla.org/firefox/) go absent
without leave and the only way I've found to get them back is to uninstall and
reinstall them. I was making a list of the ones I use a lot for my own records
and wondered whether others would find this list useful. So I'm publishing it.

## 1Password extension (desktop app required)

## Facebook Container

Facebook Container isolates your Facebook activity from the rest of your web
activity in order to prevent Facebook from tracking you outside of the Facebook
website via third party cookies.

really easy to block unwanted content!

## Running Challenges

Adds challenge progress information to your parkrun athlete results page. I've
written before about how I use this to track my [NENDY](https://bit.ly/pajNENDY)
and since then I've helped to add the
[v-index](https://running-challenges.co.uk/2019/06/09/v0.7.6-released.html).
