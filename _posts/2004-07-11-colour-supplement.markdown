Sunday, Sunday, here again. So soon. I have to say that I have been so busy
recently that this week has flown by. This has to be a good thing.
[Mrs J][thribble] has been in Miami for four weeks now. In
just under three weeks, my wife will be home. I hope the next three weeks pass
as quickly as this one did.


Since I last blogged, construction work has commenced at Johnsy Towers. I say
'construction', given that to date this has involved digging a large hole
just outside the main entrance and half-filling said aperture with cement
and removing the shelter that once protruded from the front of the building:
perhaps I should have said 'destruction'. Progress could best be described as
slow. In the original scheme of things, the ~~Porsche~~ porch was meant
to be built by now. I don't expect that the cement will be long dry by the
time my wife returns.

On Tuesday night, of course, I was up at Piccadilly Circus with long-time chum
James Casey, whom I bumped into by
chance while awaiting a cancelled train at East Croydon Station. We made our
way up to the City to join a reported half-a-million other people watching the 
spectacle that was Formula 1 Comes to Regent Street. From our position, we got 
to see six out of the eight drivers. These were:

1. [Nigel Mansell][mansell] in the [Jordan][jordan]
2. [Cristiano da Matta][da-matta] in the [Toyota][toyota]
3. [Luca Badoer][badoer] in the Ferrari
4. [Jenson Button][button] in the [BAR][bar]
5. [Zsolt Baumgartner][baumgartner] and Kylie Flynn in a two-seater [Minardi][minardi]
6. [David Coulthard][dc] in the [McLaren][mclaren]
7. [Juan Pablo Montoya][montoya] in the [WilliamsF1][williams]
8. [Martin Brundle][brundle] in the Jaguar

I was saddened to hear that Minardi's Sporting Director, John Walton, died 
shortly after this tremendous event. My sympathies go to his family, his many 
friends in the pit-lane and his partner, [Louise Goodman][goodman].

Today, of course, is the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, an event to which 
I always look forward.

While I go away and do all the things that I need to do before the race, I
shall leave you with a link to the excellent [Lego Holy Grail film][lego]. A couple of 
which have been linked to [elsewhere][planet-mad] of late!
