Sunday, Sunday, here again. So soon. I have to say that I have been so busy
recently that his week has flown by. This has to be a good thing.
<a href="http://thribble.blogspot.com/">Mrs J</a> has been in Miami for four weeks now. In
just under three weeks, my wife will be home. I hope the next three weeks pass
as quickly as this one did.


Since I last blogged, construction work has commenced at Johnsy Towers. I say
'construction', Given that to date this has involved digging a large hole
just outside the main entrance and half-filling said aperture with cement
and removing the shelter that once protruded from the front of the building:
perhaps I should have said 'destruction'. Progress could best be described as
slow. In the original scheme of things, the <del>Porsche</del> porch was meant
to be built by now. It don't expect that the cement will be long dry by the
time my wife returns.


On Tuesday night, of course, I was up at Piccadilly Circus with long-time chum
<a href="http://www.jamescasey.co.uk/">James Casey</a>, whom I bumped into by
chance while awaiting a cancelled train at East Croydon Station. We made our
way up to the City to join
<a href="http://www.itv-f1.com/News_Article.aspx?PO_ID=30614">a reported
half-a-million</a> other people watching the spectacle that was
<a href="http://www.regentstreetonline.com/f1/">Formula 1 Comes to Regent
Street</a>. From our position, we got to see six out of the eight drivers.
These were:

I was saddened to hear that Minardi's Sporting Director,
<a href="http://www.minardi.it/press/dettaglio.asp?IDComunicato=1561&amp;LN=UK&amp;IDGara=95&amp;IDComunicatiTipo=3">John
Walton</a>, died shortly after this tremendous event. My sympathies go to his
family, his many friends in the pit-lane and his partner,
<a href="http://www.louisegoodman.com/">Louise Goodman</a>.


Today, of course, is the
<a href="http://www.fia.com/sport/Championships/F1/F1_Circuits/Britain/2004.html">Grand
Prix of Great Britain</a>, an event to which I always look forward.


While I go away and do all the things that I need to do before the race, I
shall leave you with a link to the excellent
