title: Can You Tell What it is, yet?
---

[Yesterday I mentioned](https://johnsy.com/blog/entry/20060930221314) how nice it
is to be awoken by rays of golden sunshine, particularly when shortly afterwards
you realise that you don't have to go to work!


This morning I was awake before the alarm clock went off (despite staying up
until the small hours of the morning to watch the Chinese Grand Prix). The alarm
in question is a clock radio, which we have tuned to [ABC Classic
FM](https://www.abc.net.au/classic/) as I rate by woken up by radio commercials
below being woken up by dogs barking. Usually, we find ourselves being eased
into the working day by a soothing symphony, but this morning's wake-up call was
a little stranger...


I thought I was hearing things as sounds of a male voice choir filled the
bedroom; the words were familiar, but the sound was not. Realisation dawned
after a few seconds that what I was listening to was a rendition of the classic
Australian hymn, _Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport_.


This may not be as good a start to the day as discovering that you have an
entire day off work, but [Rolf Harris](https://www.rolfharris.com/) never fails
to entertain me, so I rate that as a good start to the day.


I'm a big fan of Rolf's and have been ever since I was a small boy and he was
cheerfully drawing cartoon characters on the television with huge, thick marker
pens while whistling or humming a tune. I remember seeing his face on the box of
the stylophone my parents gave me and thinking wow, that can't be the same guy.
Rolf was also part of a _Learn to Swim_ campaign when I was small. Even them I
remember wondering if there was any end to this bloke's talents when I heard
that as a small boy he was [the Australian junior backstroke
champion](https://www.abc.net.au/gnt/people/Transcripts/s1072655.htm). Out of all
of the entertainers in the World, Rolf is the only one who I can think of who
has entertained me all the way through my life, including the time [I saw him
perform live](/blog//2004/07/19/well/).


My favourite Rolf memory (so far) is that he was kind enough to autograph a
boomerang that [James](https://jamescasey.co.uk/) sent him, which we then gave to
[Kris](https://cafe.jenkster.com/) as a present, hoping that he would return from
his travels to Australia (isn't it odd that now he and his wife-to-be are living
in London and _K_ and I are over here in Melbourne?). I'd like to buy Rolf a
beer for that (Rolf, if you're reading, do pop in and see me next time you're
Down Under)!
