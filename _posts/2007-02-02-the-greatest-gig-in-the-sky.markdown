title: The Greatest Gig In The Sky!
---

Wow!


We're just in from seeing [Roger
Waters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Waters) perform [The Dark Side of the
Moon
Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Waters_-_The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon_Live_%282006_tour%29)
in an [arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Laver_Arena) that hosted [the
Australian Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open) finals last
weekend and will contain very different
[waters](https://www.theage.com.au/news/sport/swimmers-to-make-a-splash-at-rod-laver/2005/07/31/1122748526933.html)
next month.


I don't know what to say about the gig. It was fantastic: gave the album at
least one new dimension. There were several moments when the hairs on the back
of my neck stood on end, not least during _Brain Damage_. And I had shivers down
my spine during _Comfortably Numb_. I also had bass envy, but that's another
story. The show was awesome and you should go and see it when it comes within
500 miles of you.  _K_ particularly enjoyed the flying pig at the end of the
first set!


Must get some sleep now, the 6 nations rugby starts late tomorrow night and
there's talk of going to see one [Eric Clapton](https://www.ericclapton.com/) on
Sunday. Two legends in one weekend!
