This weekend I have upgraded my old laptop to run Ubuntu 8.04 ([Hardy
Heron](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardyHeron)). The experience was suitably
painless and Hardy is running smoothly. Since I've had my MacBook Pro, I've
hardly opened the lid on the old laptop, it has just sat (reasonably) quietly in
the corner of the room listening for [SSH](https://www.openssh.org/) connections
and performing downloads for me.

Under Hardy's predecessor, [Gutsy Gibbon](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/GutsyGibbon)
the connection to our <acronym title="Home Theatre PC">HTPC</acronym> (which is
still running [Windows XP Media Center
Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/default.mspx)) had been
a little flaky, which meant that often I would transfer files between the two
using an [SD
card](https://www.sandisk.com/Products/Item(1853)-Shipping%20in%20October-SanDisk_Ultra_II_SD_Plus_USB_2GB.aspx)
rather than simply copying them using <a title="SMB filesystem"
href="https://samba.org/samba/smbfs/">smbfs</a>.

It turns out that smbfs has been deprecated in Hardy and the time has come for
me to move over to <a href="https://linux-cifs.samba.org/" title="Common Internet
File System">CIFS</a>. This was actually pretty simple, but I understand some
people have struggled with the conversion, so I thought I'd document what I did
here.

1. Unmount the old smbfs mounts for the last time:

{% highlight sh %}
sudo umount -at smbfs
{% endhighlight %}

1. Grant all users full access to the mount point:

{% highlight sh %}
chmod 777 /media/<mountpoint>
{% endhighlight %}

1. Update `/etc/fstab` to use `cifs` rather than `smbfs`, changing the
_mask_s to _modes_ and ensuring that the octal modes have
leading zeros, thus.

## Before:

{% highlight kconfig %}
//server/share     /media/mountpoint        smbfs
auto,credentials=/etc/smbcredentials,workgroup=WORKGROUP,gid=smb,uid=1000,fmask=770,dmask=770,rw 
0       0
{% endhighlight %}


## After:

{% highlight kconfig %}
//server/share     /media/mountpoint        _cifs_
auto,credentials=/etc/smbcredentials,workgroup=WORKGROUP,gid=smb,uid=1000,_file_mode_=_0_770,_dir_mode_=_0_770,rw
0       0
{% endhighlight %}

1. Mount the CIFS mounts:

{% highlight sh %}
sudo mount -vat cifs
{% endhighlight %}

And that's it: fast and easy!
