title: Target $2,000!
---

Dear all,


You are quick, and generous. You are kind but _brutal_. I thought that calls for
me to have my legs waxed were harsh, but you've quickly rallied together and
raised the extra $500 I suggested would be enough for this to happen. And now it
must. I have to say that I am _dreading_ this.


Now there are calls for a &quot;<acronym title="Back, Sack and
Crack">BSC</acronym>&quot;. I'm sorry to have to disappoint but despite my
hirsuteness, for reasons unbeknownst to me, I don't have a hairy back. And since
neither the 'sack' nor the 'crack' will be photographed in the name of good
taste, this would be a pointless (yet painful, I imagine) exercise.


Since you have reached the $1,000 target I feel duty bound to offer more so that
you might do the same. This time I am doubling the target to in return for my
shaven arms and chest.


I feel I should mention that this is not an event that I am undertaking lightly.
I really, really don't like shaving my face in the morning. To shave more than
that is a huge ask, so _please_ drop by [my profile
page](https://my.imisfriendraising.com.au/personalPage.aspx?SID=54895), [give
generously](https://secure.imisfriendraising.com.au/registrant/donate.aspx?EventID=9529&amp;LangPref=en-CA&amp;SPID=1239819)
and help me help the [Leukaemia Foundation](https://www.leukaemia.org.au/) in
[World's Greatest Shave](https://www.worldsgreatestshave.com/).


As ever, I'm deeply thankful for your support, be it financial or emotional!


Much love;
<br />

P.S: If there are any Olympic cyclists, swimmers or cross-dressers out there, I
have a burning question: Do you use the same shaving products for your face as
your body hair or do you use a products aimed at women?
