title: Digereally doo all that?

Time really does fly when you're having fun. This is our last morning in
Australia and I'm sat, once more, at the patio table at _B_ and
_M_'s house. _B_ is barbecuing breakfast for the six of us and
it smells delicious. _K_ is stowing the wine for our passage back to
the Northern Hemisphere. A good opportunity for me to write about the past few
days. I have been very slack both with the laptop and the camera over the past
few days, which is a shame.


_M_'s uncle has just reached the ripe young age of seventy years. His
family organised a party for him in their home town of Gunnadah, to which my
wife and I were kindly invited.


Gunnadah is a fair distance from here. Probably about five hours drive, or
thereabouts. _N_ and _M_ wisely suggested that we break up the
journey by stopping off in Australia's famous Hunter Valley, to take in a
couple of wineries and (more importantly) their produce!


Three wineries we visited: Macguigan's, Pepper Tree and Keith Tulloch. At each
of these we sampled a wide range of wines, but it was only at the latter of
them that we seemed to enjoy every sample as much as the last. Perhaps this
was because the tasting was so much more relaxed: we were sitting in comfy
chairs in a first floor room with an almost three-hundred-and-sixty degree
panorama of the Hunter Valley, with Keith Tulloch among us explaining about how
each of the wines were made and discussing the subtle differences between
Australian and French wine-making.


We arrived in Gunnadah some hours later, with _M_'s father. Our hosts
had booked us all into a lovely motel, which was conveniently situated a few
metres away from the venue for the evening's event. The birthday celebrations
went off without a hitch and some of _M_'s uncle's many friends and
relations took the microphone during and after a scrumptious meal, to tell
stories about the past seventy years. I was very pleased to be there.


The following morning, which was very sunny, we were all invited to an early
breakfast at _M_'s uncle's house. Over barbecued sausages, bacon, eggs,
mushrooms, etc., we chatted with some of the people we had met the night
before, who were all keen to hear about where we were from and what we did.
They were a very friendly bunch. _M_'s father insisted that when we
return to New South Wales that we gave him some notice and that he would spend
two weeks showing us the _real_ Australia! _M_'s Uncle made me
promise that I'd come to his next 70th birthday and that I would bring royalty
with me. I'll be working on that when I get back!


We made our way back to suburban Sydney via Newcastle (driving through Hexham
and Stockton!), which is on the coast and has a number of shipyards. It's a
very pretty town with gorgeous long beaches and great hills for flying kites
and so forth. Mrs Johns seemed to think that this would be a good place to
live. Also on the journey home, we met _N_'s horse, _Cover
Girl_.


Nearly a day has passed since I started typing these words. We have just had a
very early breakfast up above the clouds on
<abbr title="Queensland and Northern Territory's Air Service">Qantas</abbr>
flight twenty-one to Tokyo.


We spent yesterday saying goodbye to the marsupials of Australasia and also to
our friends who had made us feel so welcome and so at home on our visit to
Australia. We also spent a fair amount of time shopping. I shall be writing
more about my favourite purchase at a later point in time. Suffice to say that
it is rechargeable, holds 40Gb of music files, is made by a company named after
something that grows on trees and was 75% of the retail price at home :-)


As the sun rises in the land of the rising sun, I'm getting excited about the
next four days that we'll be spending there. We land in Tokyo in just over an
hour. After we have collected our baggage and didgeridoo, we will be met by my
old friend _S_, who has spent a lot of time arranging things for us to
do during our short stay. Today is _S_'s second wedding anniversary, so
we're especially grateful for him getting up at ludicrous o'clock to pick us
up at Narita Airport.


More exciting updates later, I'm sure!
