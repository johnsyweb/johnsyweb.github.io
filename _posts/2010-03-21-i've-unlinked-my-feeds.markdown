In case you were wondering, I have unlinked my feeds. For what it's worth, I
think you should
[unlink your feeds][manifesto] too.
Life is short, time is precious and I certainly don't have the inclination to
read the same words twice (sometimes more) in one day. Do you?

[Google Buzz][buzz] was the straw that broke
the proverbial camel's back. I'm yet to see the point of Buzz;
[Wave][wave] I get and I like. Buzz, however seems
to be just a waste of time, duplicating items already shared in
[Google Reader][reader],
[Twitter][twitter] tweets,
blogs, _etcetera_, _etcetera_, ...

It has to stop!

Like in [Ghostbusters][ghostbusters], we must
never [cross the streams][streams].

Some of the streams that I had once consolidated but have since torn asunder are
enumerated below, in case you were used to having them aggregated:

- [My Flickr photostream][flickr]
- My shared items on Google Reader (now defunct)
- [_paj_Log][blog], my blog
- [My recently listened tracks][lastfm] on [Last.fm][lastfm-home]
- [My tweets][twitter-me] on [Twitter][twitter]
- [My recent Youtube videos][youtube]

There are a few others, such as [my Facebook
profile][facebook], but I think a wise reader like
yourself is getting the gist of how to find me online.
