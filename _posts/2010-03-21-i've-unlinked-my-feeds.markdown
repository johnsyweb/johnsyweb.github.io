title: I've unlinked my feeds
---

In case you were wondering, I have unlinked my feeds. For what it's worth, I
think you should
[unlink your feeds](https://unlinkyourfeeds.tumblr.com/post/387644253/a-manifesto) too.
Life is short, time is precious and I certainly don't have the inclination to
read the same words twice (sometimes more) in one day. Do you?


[Google Buzz](https://www.google.com/buzz) was the straw that broke
the proverbial camel's back. I'm yet to see the point of Buzz;
[Wave](https://wave.google.com/) I get and I like. Buzz, however seems
to be just a waste of time, duplicating items already shared in
[Google Reader](https://www.google.com/reader/),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/) tweets,
blogs, _etcetera_, _etcetera_, ...


It has to stop!


Like in [Ghostbusters](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087332/), we must
never [cross the streams](https://youtu.be/VjZP7jIR40w).


Some of the streams that I had once consolidated but have since torn asunder are
enumerated below, in case you were used to having them aggregated:

- [My Flickr photostream](https://flickr.com/photos/johnsyweb/)
- [My shared items](https://google.com/reader/shared/johnsyweb) on [Google Reader](https://www.google.com/reader/)
- [_paj_Log](https://johnsy.com/blog/), my blog
- [My recently listened tracks](https://last.fm/user/johnsyweb) on [Last.fm](https://last.fm/)
- [My tweets](https://twitter.com/johnsyweb/) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)
- [My recent Youtube videos](https://youtube.com/user/johnsyweb)

There are a few others, such as [my Facebook
profile](https://www.facebook.com/johnsyweb), but I think a wise reader like
yourself is getting the gist of how to find me online.
