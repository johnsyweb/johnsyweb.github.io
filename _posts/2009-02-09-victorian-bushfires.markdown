I understand that reports of the local [bushfires][bushfires] have reached the [international news][bbc].

Thank you to those from overseas who have been concerned for us. We're fine,
thankfully.

It's hard to know what to say. It's devastating that so many properties and
livelihoods are being destroyed and people are dying essentially due to the
weather. Some of the fires have been started deliberately, which I'm still
finding incredibly hard to comprehend.

Some of our friends have been affected who have families and properties out in
Country Victoria. Here in the suburbs we can't even smell the smoke, which is
very fortunate.

For those wondering what they can do to help those affected by these horrendous
fires, please visit the [Australian Red Cross][redcross] website and make a donation. If
you can, [Donate Blood][lifeblood] (we cannot, because
we're POMs and may have Mad Cow Disease).
