[Two Bays Trail Run] is my favourite annual running event. The 28km trail run from Dromana to [Cape Schanck] on the [Mornington Peninsula] is just spectacular. The 56km from Cape Schanck to Cape Schanck via Dromana is... a little beyond me right now.
Each time I participate, either as a runner or as a volunteer, I am more than impressed by the smoothness of the organisation and by the superb positive vibe that seems to fill the entire peninsula. It feels less like a race than you might imagine, and more like a day in the bush with your mates. Some of the views are breathtaking, and some of the steps, if you try to run up them, are also breathtaking. In a different way.

The buzz this year started on Saturday when we visited [Red Hill Rail Trail parkrun] as a family and there were so many participants wearing Two Bays apparel. One of the local coffee shops was almost entirely populated by parkrun tourists, like ourselves.

My preparation had not gone so well this year. I left qualification late and just snuck in under the threshold with a half marathon at [Run for the Young]. The night before the event, I managed to drop something heavy on my right big toe, which left a bruise. Then I discovered that [my hyration pack] had sprung a leak from where the hose joins the bladder. We tried to patch it up but to no avail. I figured if I put it in the bag upside down, it would not leak so much and I would still be able to drink from the hose. It was a nice idea.

Within the first 100m of the run on Sunday, I could feel drops of water trickling down my back. By the time I had been up and over Arthur's Seat, my shorts were so drenched I could wring them out. I spent a bit of time rearranging the contents of my bag so that important things like my phone, which I was carrying in case of emergency, didn't get soaked. The discomfort from the water was unpleasant and did dampen my enjoyment until later in the event when the water level had dropped sufficiently to stop the leaking and the warm January weather had dried the technical fabrics that make up my running attire. I got to run alongside a couple of friends for a short while. I also met an absolutely inspirational runner who had overcome incredible challenges just to get to the starting line. 5km (just a parkrun) before the finish line I got to tell a comedian how much I enjoyed his most recent show. I love trail running.

_DJ_ met me towards the end of the course, gave me a big hug and ran with me towards the finish line. While not the race I was hoping to run, I finished with a huge smile on my face and a sense of satisfaction.

*With the Merri Creek Running Club legends who all finished ahead of me 💜*

I look forward to returning in 2026. Maybe I'll reverse the trend of running slower each year, much like I have at [Melbourne Marathon]. Or maybe I won't. I'll have a great time regardless, I am sure.
