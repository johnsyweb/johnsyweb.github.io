Inspired by "[Desert Island Discs]", which is a long-running BBC Radio 4 programme where guests are asked to choose their favourite music tracks, a book, and a luxury item they would take with them if they were stranded on a desert island, I thought I'd write mine down. I used to listen to this many years ago when I lived in the UK and rediscovered it a few years ago on [BBC Sounds]. I love the concept where folks reflect on their musical tastes and the significance of certain tracks in their lives and share their stories. I've even had the kids listen to episodes recently.

Music is such a big part of my life, and I have so many tracks that I love, so it was hard to narrow it down to just eight. However you may know me, you'll have some insight into my musical tastes, I am sure. But I am also sure I will surprise you.

Here goes!

## The Tracks

### Track 1: Spirit of Radio - Rush

One of my earliest memories is of the radio playing in the small kitchen in our family home. I remember the familiar and friendly voices of DJs like Alan Freeman, Tony Blackburn, and Dave Lee Travis. The radio was a constant sound. Dad used to drive a lot for work as a sales representative. He collected "Tiger Tokens" as he filled his petrol tank and one day he gave me a stack of these coupons, which I could use to claim an item from a catalogue. I chose an alarm clock radio and was hugely excited to set this device up in my bedroom. If I was in my room and awake, the radio would be going, morning, noon or night. I loved the variety of the music. I enjoyed the comedy, the stories, and the access to news and current affairs.

Ironically, I don't think I ever heard Rush on the radio. I discovered their music many years later and there are so many Rush songs that I love now. The lyrics to this one really speak to me.

### Track 2: It's The End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine) - R.E.M&period;

I first saw R.E.M. perform live in Milton Keynes in 1995. It was one of the first concerts I attended and I saw them on two consecutive nights. I feel very lucky that (unlike Rush) I got to see R.E.M. many times over the years and I absolutely love their music.

There's something about this particular song that I cannot put my finger on, but it's the one song that I put on when I am having a bad day. By the time Michael Stipe starts singing the first chorus, I'll have a smile on my face. It never fails to pick me up. Never mind laughter, this is the best medicine for me!

### Track 3: Vyšehrad - Bedřich Smetana

Classical music wasn't something I had a great deal of exposure to in my younger years. My great uncle Jack had a large collection of classical records that I understand he would play at volume at home. When he died, his vinyl collection came to our home and I played some of the Deutsche Grammophon long players on our turntable, but that was about it. When I was in sixth form, my family moved away to be closer to Dad's work and to reduce the amount of time he spent on the road at a time when my sister was a baby and sleep was in short supply. I moved in with family friends and their kitchen radio was tuned to one of the classical radio stations. This was the time that I first became familiar with classical pieces.

A few years later I would meet my wife, who played violin in orchestras. When we started seeing each other seriously, I tuned my radio to one of the classical stations so that I could form a better appreciation of this genre, so that I wouldn't look like a complete philistine turning up to one of her concerts.

One of the first trips we made together was to Prague and Kirsty took me to Vyšehrad Cemetery, the final resting place of many notable composers including Antonín Dvořák and Bedřich Smetana. On that trip she also bought a Czech recording of Má vlast, which is still in our CD collection. It's a beautiful and evocative set of six symphonic poems, which I listen to often. I'm choosing the first piece because I am always drawn in by those opening sounds of the harp playing.

### Track 4: Can't Take My Eyes Off You - Andy Williams

Isn't this the ultimate love song? It certainly has a special place in my heart and it makes me think of the people closest to me.

I first heard James Dean Bradfield of the Manic Street Preachers performing this song with his acoustic guitar and I thought it was absolutely beautiful. Being a nerd, I looked into who wrote the song and found that it had been written by Bob Crewe and Bob Gaudio, and first recorded and released as a single by Gaudio's Four Seasons bandmate Frankie Valli, but then covered many, many times over. I listened to many of these covers over the years and Andy Williams's version is my favourite.

It became a special song in 2002 when we were walking through Prague (Prague again!) on my stag night. My friend Alastair started singing it as we were heading towards a bar on a freezing cold Czech night. One by one the members of the party joined in and enthusiastically imitated the horn section. At our wedding a few weeks later, we had a ceilidh band play. In an intermission, without warning, the members of the stag party began singing this song and many of our guests joined in. The band said they'd never heard anything quite like it. We chose to take that as a compliment.

### Track 5: In the Land of Grey and Pink - Caravan

My love of vinyl records was born in the back room of one of our friends' houses when I was about 12 years old. Roger was the same age as my dad and grew up in South Wales. He was a real music lover and had an amazing collection of records that he'd built up over the years. He took me to my first ever concert, Guns N' Roses, in 1993. When he heard their cover of _Knockin' on Heaven's Door_, he insisted that I hear Bob Dylan's version and pulled out a well-loved copy of _Before the Flood_ from the 70s. I coveted his record collection from that day.

Roger would happily put on an LP when I was at his house and he introduced me to many bands that I still love to this day. Some of these were well-known, like Pink Floyd, Alice Cooper, Thin Lizzy, E.L.O., and The Beatles. Others were more obscure like Caravan, Camel and Man.

I play the album _In the Land of Grey and Pink_ often and think of Roger, who died of cancer over 20 years ago now. This is the title track and will remind me to keep good dental hygiene on the island.

### Track 6: Zombie (Acoustic) - The Cranberries

The death of someone I don't know doesn't normally affect me, but I'll never forget being on the Mornington Peninsula the morning I heard that Dolores O'Riordan had died. I went out for a run and somebody was blasting Zombie out of an upstairs window. I had to stop and listen. Coincidentally, I was in the same place when I learned that Neil Peart of Rush had died two years later.

The Cranberries were a band that my whole family could listen to. I remember Mum buying Dad the cassette of their debut album and it being in the car stereo for a long time. I confess, I still have that cassette (and nothing to play it on).

When I learned to play the bass guitar, Zombie was one of the first songs I learned to play all the way through. I played it in a battle of the bands at work once and my friend Adrian said to me after our first rehearsal that I had such a big smile on my face as we played it, it must be a very special song! It is.

The acoustic version is wonderful. Every time I would listen to this with my friend Alastair, one of us would have to say, "Rippin' song, this!"

Rippin' song, this!

### Track 7: The Chariot - The Cat Empire

Melbourne has been my home for the last two decades and I need a song that takes me back there. The Cat Empire are a Melbourne institution and this song takes me back to one of the very first live shows I saw in the city with Kirsty at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. The band are incredible and I love this message of the power of music. You can't help but feel moved by it.

Please turn this one up!

### Track 8: Life's Shadow - Beckett

Perhaps a little maudlin for a desert island, but this track by the little-known Geordie progressive rock band needs to be played more. Some people may recognise parts of it as they found their way into a heavy metal classic, but that's not my story to tell.

It's the story of a man on death row. "Please don't worry 'cos I've gone". When I go. Wherever I go. I don't want anyone to worry.

## The Book

![The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy book cover][hhgg-cover]{: .image-left}

_The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ by Douglas Adams. I must have read it more than a dozen times at this point and I would read it many dozen more. The wit and wisdom of Douglas Adams never cease to entertain me. And it would serve as a reminder, "Don't Panic!"

## The Luxury Item

![A wind-up radio][radio-image]{: .image-right}

I've never known what I would choose for this. Until I collected my eight tracks. It would absolutely have to be a wind-up radio. While I am sure I would love the sounds of waves crashing on the beach on that desert island, I would be pining for the spirit of radio to keep me company until I am rescued.

## The One Record I'd Save From the Waves

![R.E.M. It's The End of the World As We Know It 7-inch vinyl single][rem-vinyl]{: .image-left}

If the desert island was on fire and I could only save one record, it would be _It's The End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)_, without a doubt. If I lost the other seven records, I would be very glum indeed. I would need to put this on the turntable and crank it up to eleven to lift my spirits back up! Maybe if I listen to it enough I'll be able to sing all the words correctly and as quickly as Michael Stipe.
