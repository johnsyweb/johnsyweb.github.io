title: Camping in the Peak District
---



Camping. You really can't beat it! This Summer Bank Holiday weekend we decided
to get away from it all, with a couple of friends, and head up to <a
href="http://www.peakdistrict-nationalpark.com/">The Peak District</a>. We
really were blessed with both the weather and the traffic being ideal for a
stress-free break. We set up camp at a lovely site in the picturesque village of
<a href="http://www.birchovervillage.co.uk/">Birchover</a>, not a million miles
from The Red Lion public house! Most of Saturday was spent on the <a
href="http://www.peakdistrict.org/Pages/Pfoot.htm">Limestone Way</a>. It'd been
ages since I'd done any 'proper' walking and I thoroughly enjoyed working up
those blisters! On Saturday evening we drove over to Matlock Bath for the first
night of the town's illuminations. The river banks were adorned with illuminated
animals and decorated boats sailed up and down the river. Definitely something
to visit if you're in the area!
