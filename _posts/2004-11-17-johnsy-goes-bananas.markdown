A few words, if I may (and I may), about a concert we enjoyed last night.


The evening started off with bitter, bitter disappointment as we arrived at
the venue shortly after the advertised door-opening time and long before the
advertised showtime. It was when we were collecting our tickets that we were
to discover that <a href="http://www.roguestudios.co.uk/dh/">Dean Howard</a>
had already finished their set and that
<a href="http://www.thunderonline.com/">Thunder</a> were taking to the stage.
I had been looking forward to this gig for
<a href="http://johnsy.com/blog/?entry=20040918144509">quite some time</a>, so I was quite
browned off to miss Dave's live performance.


Thunder's short set was very good indeed. In fact, I now quite fancy seeing
them at one of
<a href="http://www.thunderonline.com/thunder/gigs/">their own gigs</a>.


<a href="http://www.frampton.com/">Peter Frampton</a> has never really been 'my
bag', I have to say. I was quite tempted to sit in the (smoke free) bar during
his set, but thought better of it. I have to say that I was really very
impressed at the quality of the music. The tribute to the Men of Black Watch
was touching and his encore, _While My Guitar Gently Weeps_, was
absolutely superb!

There wasn't too great a delay before the main act came onstage.
<a href="http://www.deep-purple.com/">Deep Purple</a> kicked off the set with
_Silver Tongue_ from their latest record (mental note: must buy copy of
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000A5BU2/johnsydotorg-21/">Bananas</a>,
I have the MP3s that I downloaded for evaluation purposes for too long now).
This was pretty good, but the show really got started (for me)
when they played the opening track to their 1973 album
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000A5BU2/johnsydotorg-21/">Who
Do We Think We Are?</a>, _Woman From Tokyo_.
<a href="http://www.gillan.com/">Ian Gillan</a>, who appeared to have come
onstage barefoot in his pyjamas, introduced the concept of air-Hammond to the
crowd before returning to the Bananas album for _I Got Your Number_.
The next song was from <a
href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000005RRP/johnsydotorg-21/">Fireball</a>:
_Strange Kind Of Woman_. Gillan's amusing little anecdotes in-between
songs added to the occasion. The next delight was _Bananas_: the song, not the
fruit! _Demon's Eye_ was an unexpected treat from the Fireball album,
followed up by _The Well-Dressed Guitar_.
<a href="http://www.stevemorse.com/">Steve Morse</a> played through the
blinding instrumental _Contact Lost_,
<a href="http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/deep_purple_space_shuttle_columbia_tribute.html">a
tribute to the crew of Space Shuttle Columbia</a>. The mood was lifted then by
_Knocking At Your Back Door_ from
<a
href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000JBFW/johnsydotorg-21/">Perfect
Strangers</a>, which merged nicely into
<a href="http://www.donairey.com/">Don</a> Airey's awesome Hammond
extravaganza, culminating in the title track from _Perfect Strangers_.
The main set was to finish with three songs from an album I always have a copy
of in the car,
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000006UD8/johnsydotorg-21/">Machine
Head</a>, these were: _Highway Star_, _Space Truckin'_ and the
inevitable _Smoke On The Water_. Sadly, I'd snapped the G string on my
shiny new air guitar, whilst tuning up, so I had to leave the guitar solo up
to the man on the stage (he did an impressive job, too). I still managed to
play the opening chords to perfection, of course!


The encore was quite literally,
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000005RQT/johnsydotorg-21/">In
Rock</a> (if you like rock music, you _must_ own a copy of this album):
a ten-minute version of _Speed King_, featuring an impressive bass solo
from <a href="http://www.rogerglover.com/">Roger Glover</a> and a small drum
solo from <a href="http://www.deep-purple.com/band/?paice">Ian Paice</a>,
before the grand finale: _Black Night_ (the second song that Mrs Johns
knew of the set)!


Deep Purple are without a doubt one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
Seeing them live not only confirmed these thoughts, but also gave me a new
sense of respect for those musicians. Highly recommended.
