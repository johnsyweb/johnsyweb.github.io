A few words, if I may (and I may), about a concert we enjoyed last night.

The evening started off with bitter, bitter disappointment as we arrived at the venue shortly after the advertised door-opening time and long before the advertised showtime. It was when we were collecting our tickets that we were to discover that [Dean Howard][dean-howard] had already finished their set and that [Thunder][thunder] were taking to the stage. I had been looking forward to this gig for quite some time, so I was quite browned off to miss Dave's live performance.

Thunder's short set was very good indeed. In fact, I now quite fancy seeing them at one of their own gigs.

[Peter Frampton][peter-frampton] has never really been 'my bag', I have to say. I was quite tempted to sit in the (smoke free) bar during his set, but thought better of it. I have to say that I was really very impressed at the quality of the music. The tribute to the Men of Black Watch was touching and his encore, _While My Guitar Gently Weeps_, was absolutely superb!

There wasn't too great a delay before the main act came onstage. [Deep Purple][deep-purple] kicked off the set with _Silver Tongue_ from their latest record (mental note: must buy copy of [Bananas][bananas-album], I have the MP3s that I downloaded for evaluation purposes for too long now). This was pretty good, but the show really got started (for me) when they played the opening track to their 1973 album [Who Do We Think We Are?][who-do-we-think], _Woman From Tokyo_. [Ian Gillan][ian-gillan], who appeared to have come onstage barefoot in his pyjamas, introduced the concept of air-Hammond to the crowd before returning to the Bananas album for _I Got Your Number_. The next song was from [Fireball][fireball-album]: _Strange Kind Of Woman_. Gillan's amusing little anecdotes in-between songs added to the occasion. The next delight was _Bananas_: the song, not the fruit! _Demon's Eye_ was an unexpected treat from the Fireball album, followed up by _The Well-Dressed Guitar_. [Steve Morse][steve-morse] played through the blinding instrumental _Contact Lost_, [a tribute to the crew of Space Shuttle Columbia][contact-lost-tribute]. The mood was lifted then by _Knocking At Your Back Door_ from [Perfect Strangers][perfect-strangers], which merged nicely into [Don][don-airey] Airey's awesome Hammond extravaganza, culminating in the title track from _Perfect Strangers_. The main set was to finish with three songs from an album I always have a copy of in the car, [Machine Head][machine-head]; these were: _Highway Star_, _Space Truckin'_ and the inevitable _Smoke On The Water_. Sadly, I'd snapped the G string on my shiny new air guitar, whilst tuning up, so I had to leave the guitar solo up to the man on the stage (he did an impressive job, too). I still managed to play the opening chords to perfection, of course!

The encore was quite literally [In Rock][in-rock] (if you like rock music, you _must_ own a copy of this album): a ten-minute version of _Speed King_, featuring an impressive bass solo from [Roger Glover][roger-glover] and a small drum solo from [Ian Paice][ian-paice], before the grand finale: _Black Night_ (the second song that Mrs Johns knew of the set)!

Deep Purple are without a doubt one of the greatest rock bands of all time. Seeing them live not only confirmed these thoughts, but also gave me a new sense of respect for those musicians. Highly recommended.
