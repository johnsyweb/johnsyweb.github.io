In The Before Times™ we used to like to go to restaurants. Of course, part of
the restaurant dining experience is being asked, "how is your meal?" Just as a
forkful of said meal has entered the diner's mouth. There's a polite nod with
the mouth covered by a hand, followed by a quiet acknowledgement, “very nice.
Thank you!” And that is that. The review is acknowledged.

These days, we cannot go to restaurants, we have to buy things online and
surrender an email address. Sometime after making a purchase, we're e-mithered,
“Your opinion is important to us” and there are five stars inviting attention.
The review does not stop with the retailer; it is to be broadcast to the entire
world along with other data important to the reviewee: name, location, age range
and gender.

>   Very nice. Thank you.
