Having being contemplating a [career break] for a little over six months, it feels rather strange that today is my last day at work for a year. I'm keen to keep in touch, while not thinking about the day-to-day of work, so this will be my mechanism for broadcasting what I'm doing and sharing my [contact details].

I am feeling very grateful that I am in the privileged position to be able to stop working for twelve months to spend more time with my family. And I am very thankful to the people at work who have been so supportive of my decision; this move has triggered a bunch of organisational changes, which I think will provide some great opportunities for people to try and to succeed in new endeavours. It's an exciting time.

I'm also very excited to see my parents and siblings in the UK later this week, it has been a while. Let's go!
