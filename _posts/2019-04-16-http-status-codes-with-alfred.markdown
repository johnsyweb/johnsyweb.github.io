title: HTTP Status Codes with Alfred

I've been doing commercial web-based development for about six years now and I still don't haven't committed each and every HTTP status code to memory. I refer often to [HTTP Status Codes &mdash; httpstatuses.com](https://httpstatuses.com) to appear way smarter than I am.

Today I realised I could do this with fewer keystrokes (e.g. [Alt]+[Space]hs 418[Enter]) using the amazing [Alfred - Productivity App for macOS](https://www.alfredapp.com/).

Somebody's probably already done this and I wish they'd shared it with me, so I'm sharing it with you.

![Alfred Custom Search](/images/2019-04-16-http-status-codes-with-alfred.jpg "Alfred Custom Search")

You can import these settings (apart from the icon) using the following URL: [alfred://customsearch/HTTP%20Status%20Codes/hs/utf8/nospace/https%3A%2F%2Fhttpstatuses.com%2F%7Bquery%7D](alfred://customsearch/HTTP%20Status%20Codes/hs/utf8/nospace/https%3A%2F%2Fhttpstatuses.com%2F%7Bquery%7D)

I tried to share the URL in a tweet but Twitter mangled it. 

I hope this little tip helps improve your productivity.

What's your favourite Alfred custom search?

### Addendum (2019-04-22)

I am glad I shared this tip. It led to Ricky sending me this knowledge upgrade:

One `brew cask install dash` and a couple of clicks later and I found myself with an even easier workflow than I'd had before. No need for web browsers (or even an Internet connection):

Thanks Ricky!
