title: 'One-line of Python: string -> hex'
---




Just a little something that may come in handy in the future (for my reference,
rather than yours), a Python one-liner for converting an ASCII string to
hexadecimal pairs.


{% highlight python %}
to_hex = lambda s: ' '.join(['%02X' % ord(ch) for ch in s])
{% endhighlight %}


As you were...
