Since handing over the [Event
Director](https://wiki.parkrun.com/index.php/Event_Director) role at [Coburg
parkrun](http://bit.ly/pajCp) to Marcus last year, I've been taking the
opportunity to enjoy being one of the [parkrun
adventurers](https://www.facebook.com/parkrunadventurers/) and have been ticking
off my _Nearest Event Not Done Yet_ (NENDY) as time permits.

Visiting local [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.com.au/) events is a great way to
experience [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.com/) and to discover hidden gems in
our neighbourhood ([Newport Lakes
parkrun](http://www.parkrun.com.au/newportlakes/) comes to mind).

If you want to find your NENDY, install the [Running
Challenges](https://running-challenges.co.uk/) plugin in
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) or [Google
Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) on your computer (I haven't found an iOS
version) and set your home parkrun in the preferences.

The Running Challenges extension displays a whole host of fun statistics about
our parkrun participation but I'm finding the NENDY to be the most enjoyable to
chase!
