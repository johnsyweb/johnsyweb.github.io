[![Leukaemia Foundation World's Greatest Shave](http://johnsy.com/images/logo_wgs.gif "Leukaemia Foundation World's Greatest Shave")](http://www.worldsgreatestshave.com/)

The [Leukaemia Foundation World's Greatest Shave](http://www.worldsgreatestshave.com/) <strong>is happening this weekend</strong>!

To bring you up-to-date:

1. [I thought I'd raise a few bucks by shaving my head.](/2009/02/15/please-sponsor-me-in-world's-greatest-shave-2009/)
1. People wanted more to give more, so I offered to shave my legs as well as my head for $500.
1. [You called for my legs to be waxed, so I asked for $1,000.](/2009/02/25/$500-target-reached-$1000-for-the-wax/)
1. [I'm now sponsored to the tune of $1,782](http://my.imisfriendraising.com.au/personalPage.aspx?SID=54895)!
1. [Claire Fran&ccedil;oise Salon in Melbourne's CBD are going to wax my legs tomorrow (Friday) lunchtime!](http://www.clairefrancoise.com.au/awareness-campaign.htm)

Your donation will make a difference, in the short term it could mean the loss
of more of my hair, in the long term it will help those suffering with
leukaemias as they undergo treatment. As an Australian tax payer, you get to
claim your tax back at the end of the year! You'll be sent a PDF receipt when
you donate (let me know if you think you've donated but not received a receipt).

Photographs will be shared via my [Flickr
Stream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnsyweb/sets/72157614662153533/) after
the event.

Most importantly, here is the link you need to [sponsor
me](https://secure.imisfriendraising.com.au/registrant/donate.aspx?EventID=9529&amp;LangPref=en-CA&amp;SPID=1239819).
Every dollar counts. If you cannot spare a dollar right now, then perhaps leave
some words of encouragement on [my profile
page](http://my.imisfriendraising.com.au/personalPage.aspx?SID=54895). I really
appreciate the support.

Many, many thanks for your generosity, financial or otherwise.
