The [Leukaemia Foundation World's Greatest Shave][wgs] **is happening this weekend**!

To bring you up-to-date:

1. [I thought I'd raise a few bucks by shaving my head.]({% post_url 2009-02-15-please-sponsor-me-in-world-s-greatest-shave-2009 %})
1. People wanted more to give more, so I offered to shave my legs as well as my head for $500.
1. [You called for my legs to be waxed, so I asked for $1,000.]({% post_url 2009-02-25-500-target-reached-1000-for-the-wax %})
1. I'm now sponsored to the tune of $1,782!

Your donation will make a difference, in the short term it could mean the loss
of more of my hair, in the long term it will help those suffering with
leukaemias as they undergo treatment. As an Australian tax payer, you get to
claim your tax back at the end of the year!

Photographs will be shared via my [Flickr stream][flickr-wgs] after
the event.

Most importantly, visit [World's Greatest Shave][wgs] to support the cause.
Every dollar counts. Thank you for your generosity, financial or otherwise.
