I'm not sure who first said ["Comparison is the thief of joy"][1] and it doesn't
really matter. It's a pretty good adage. Often times friends of mine who run
will seek to diminish their own achievements by comparing themselves with more
accomplished, even elite, runners. And I will wheel out this quote for them
because my running friends are all pretty awesome folks who smash their goals.

And that leads me to a couple of recent examples where I have _found_ joy in
comparison.

Last weekend I ran a half-marathon with (well... slightly behind) a friend who'd
been training with me and who finished a few minutes ahead of me. I was so happy
to see all the training paying off. [Confelicity] abounds!

Then later in the week I had a blast from the past, which made me think back to
a time when I wouldn't have even contemplated running a half marathon. Comparing
2025 Pete to Past Pete in this regard was a massive source of joy.
