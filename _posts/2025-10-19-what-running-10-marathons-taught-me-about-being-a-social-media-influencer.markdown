Last Sunday I ran my seventh [Melbourne Marathon] and my tenth official marathon. It wasn't my fastest 42.2 km run, but it wasn't my slowest. I had plenty of time to think about social media influence as I saw smartphones snapping photos of my fellow marathoners. So what _did_ running ten marathons teach me about being a social media influencer?

Nothing.

It's still a great experience, and I hope to do another ten. I probably won't post much about them, though.
