I have left it so long since I last blogged, that I forget all of the trivial
things that I wanted to mention. Hey, ho. Less fat, more lean.

I shall just witter about [GuilFest 2004][guilfest], if that is alright with you. And even if it isn't. GuilFest was my
first ever music festival experience, which is odd given the amount of gigs
that I have been to. I have to say that, despite the obvious lack of wife, I
enjoyed every minute of the festival.

Gratuitous links to the bands that to which I bore witness now follow (please
hover over the links for my brief thought snippets):

- [Hot Club of Cowtown][hotclub]
- [Simple Kid][simplekid]
- [Blondie][blondie]
- [Rolf Harris][rolf] (featuring Miss Given, ladies and Gentlemen!)
- [Tim Booth And The Individuals][timbooth]
- [Katie Melua][katiemelua]
- [Simple Minds][simpleminds]
- [The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain][ukulele]
- [The Saw Doctors][sawdoctors]

I was in good company for the weekend, with oft-stars of this blog, Messrs.
Dean and Mayes by my side. They picked us a good (if not slightly sloped)
pitch. The slope didn't prove too problematic. We were at the bottom of the
camping site, which was great as we didn't have hordes of people trekking past
our tents at all hours in search of the amenities. I was very impressed with
the quality of the plumbing facilities that were on offer at GuilFest. Hats
off to the organisers there. I should have kept my hat on, mind, the
forehead's looking a tad red today!

A fine variety of rapid cuisine was available all weekend. I ate some of the
finest Jerk Chicken (with hot pickled cucumber) that I have ever eaten. The
rest of the food was good, too!

The highlight for me, was seeing Rolf live! That and hurtling groundwards at
60 miles per hour on the [Wrigley's Airwaves Drop Zone][airwaves].

I'm quite keen that this will not have been my last music festival.
