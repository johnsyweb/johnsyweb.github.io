title: Wax on. Wax off!
---

I have been delighted, so far, with the generosity of those of you who have
donated to the [Leukaemia Foundation World's Greatest
Shave](/blog/2009/02/15/please-sponsor-me-in-world's-greatest-shave-2009/), that I
mentioned recently, am mentioning now, and shall continue to mention until I've
extracted every penny that you can afford to give!


My friend [_B_](http://aboycalledbrian.blogspot.com/) left the following comment
on [my profile
page](http://my.imisfriendraising.com.au/personalPage.aspx?SID=54895):

> There are many people out there who would pay good money for you to shave
your legs. But I'd hope you'd wax too....?

If those many people are reading this, perhaps they would pay that good money of
which _B_ speaks and [sponsor
me](https://secure.imisfriendraising.com.au/registrant/donate.aspx?EventID=9529&amp;LangPref=en-CA&amp;SPID=1239819)?


As for waxing... how much is that worth to you?


Heartfelt thanks to those who have sponsored me and to those of you who will
[sponsor
me](https://secure.imisfriendraising.com.au/registrant/donate.aspx?EventID=9529&amp;LangPref=en-CA&amp;SPID=1239819)!


On a different note, I have been asked to note that [things aren't rosy over at
Facebook](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2009/02/facebook_still_showing_growing.html).
Frankly, I can't stand the site, as I demonstrated by [deleting my Facebook
account](/blog/2008/12/27/facebook-no-more/) last month.
