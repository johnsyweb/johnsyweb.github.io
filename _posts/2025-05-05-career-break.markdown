I'm taking a 12-month career break to spend more time with my family. And before anyone worries - I'm in perfect health! This is purely about making time for what matters most.

## Why Now?

_Life's too short_, isn't it? I often think about time when making big decisions. I find myself in a funny spot: I'm definitely too old for a traditional gap year, but I'm too young to retire. And I don't want to stop working anyway.

There are a few personal reasons that make this the right time. Our kids are growing up quickly, and these years are ones I don't want to miss. At the same time, my parents are getting older on the other side of the planet and I miss them. We're fortunate enough to be in a position where I can take this step back for a while.

I think a lot about this this picture from Marlay parkrun back in October 2019 - it's become a reminder to me about priorities.

## When Is This Happening?

I'll be on my career break from 1 July 2025 to 30 June 2026. A neat 12-month window and also the financial year for those in Australia.

## What Will I Be Doing?

When I mentioned to the family that I was planning a sabbatical, everyone had their thoughts as to how I'd fill my days.

Our 14-year-old, thought I would be going backpacking and napping more. Our 10-year-old is very tactile and xpected me to spend my days trampolining and enjoying "lunchtime snuggles". _K_ figured I'd visit my parents, listen to tonmeds of self-improvement audiobooks, and finally cook meals that take longer than 15 minutes to prepare.

What I'm actually planning is a seven-week adventure through the UK (including many parkruns), Portugal (for a family wedding), and Spain with my folks. Then I'll be embracing the stay-at-home dad life and saying "yes" to our kids a lot more.

I'm also training for my seventh Melbourne Marathon, brushing up on some tech skills (I've been off the tools too long), and learning to play some new songs on the bass.

## What About Work?

Work's in good shape. They'll cope without me for a year. And I am grateful that the leadership team support my decision.

## Will I Return?

I hope so. I expect the workplace will look quite different in twelve months time and that might mean returning to a different role, but that's okay. It'll be good to return refreshed and ready for the challenges of 2026.
