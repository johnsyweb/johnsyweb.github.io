Last week, after I hit the $1,000 target that would mean that I have to wax my
legs, [I mentioned](2009/02/22/how-to-shave%3F/) that I am dreading
it. I've been hearing many tales of home-waxing and also have had the scene from
[The 40 Year Old Virgin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405422/)
recounted to me more times than I would like.

Yesterday evening I had a very nice email from
[Claire Fran&ccedil;oise](http://www.clairefrancoise.com.au/),
telling me that her studio would love to be a part of the
[World's Greatest Shave](http://www.worldsgreatestshave.com/) and
that they would be more than happy to inflict 'pain' on me for the sake of a
good cause.

Since the [Claire Fran&ccedil;oise Salon](http://www.clairefrancoise.com.au/) is
only a few blocks away from my office, I can pop by in my lunch break next
Friday for the dreaded waxing.

This has calmed my nerves a little, knowing that professionals are on the
case. I promise to take some photos of the event and to blog of my first waxing
experience. I'm sure it shall be an experience.

According to the total on [my profile
page](http://my.imisfriendraising.com.au/personalPage.aspx?SID=54895), my arms
and chest are still safe but there are still ten days to go, so you still have
time to [sponsor
me](https://secure.imisfriendraising.com.au/registrant/donate.aspx?EventID=9529&amp;LangPref=en-CA&amp;SPID=1239819).

Now I must think about how to execute the head shave... I'm open to suggestions!

Thank you all, once more, for your amazing support. I really am very
appreciative.
