[![Leukaemia Foundation World's Greatest Shave][wgs-logo]][wgs]

Last week, after I hit the $1,000 target that would mean that I have to wax my
legs, [I mentioned]({% post_url 2009-02-22-how-to-shave %}) that I am dreading it. I've
been hearing many tales of home-waxing and also have had the scene from [The 40
Year Old Virgin][40yo-virgin] recounted to me more
times than I would like.

Yesterday evening I had a very nice email from
[Claire Francoise][cf-salon],
telling me that her studio would love to be a part of the
[World's Greatest Shave][wgs] and
that they would be more than happy to inflict 'pain' on me for the sake of a
good cause.

Since the [Claire Francoise Salon][cf-salon] is
only a few blocks away from my office, I can pop by in my lunch break next
Friday for the dreaded waxing.

This has calmed my nerves a little, knowing that professionals are on the
case. I promise to take some photos of the event and to blog of my first waxing
experience. I'm sure it shall be an experience.

More donations have been coming in. You can still [support men's health causes][wgs].

Now I must think about how to execute the head shave... I'm open to suggestions!

Thank you all, once more, for your amazing support. I really am very
appreciative.
