One evening right at the beginning of 2023, I got an email from
[Exercism](https://exercism.org/) inviting me to join 
[The #12in23 Challenge](https://exercism.org/challenges/12in23). I was home
alone and thought that this sounded like fun (you should see the number of
Rubik's cubes in this house to get an idea of how I define "fun"). I'd played
with Exercism a few years ago to get myself up-to-speed in Elixir, which was
looking like becoming popular when I was at [Envato](https://www.envato.com) and I
found it to be both educational and entertaining. I resolved to undertake one
language per month and one exercise per day.

On a whim, I decided to take on JavaScript for January.

It seems almost unbelievable that in close to a quarter of a century working in
software development the only
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)
I have written was in the form of a small,
[cargo-culted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming)
[change](https://github.com/fraz3alpha/running-challenges/commit/a9b83c55f9e2ab87860c57a0000881c585977b0a)
to [a parkrun-related browser plug-in](/blog/2019/07/24/essential-browser-plugins/#running-challenges). 
It's a language I've never really needed to touch and of which I have remained
pretty ignorant. It was good to finally meet it head-on.

Most days I'd be able to knock off an exercise in about 15 minutes. The only
exception to this was the exercise on the concept of
[Promises](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/concepts/promises), which was
a new concept to me and took most of a Friday evening. On a couple of days where
the exercises were really easy, I did multiple exercises, as I didn't start on 1
January and I thought it would be nice to end the month having completed (at
least) 31.

It is good to do some programming again and I actually like JavaScript more than
I expected to. 
The [nullish coalescing operator
(`??`)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing)
is a nice language feature that I don't think I have used in any other language
so far.

I'm excited for Functional February!
