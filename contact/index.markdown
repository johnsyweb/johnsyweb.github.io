## Email

If you'd like to contact me, I'd prefer to hear from you by email. My address is
my first name at (@) this domain.

## Calendar

If you'd like to book some time with me to talk about software development
teams, [parkrun] or anything else, you can do so on [Calendly][calendly].

## Social Media

I have pretty much removed myself from all forms of social media. You may still
find me around the Internet as @johnsyweb. I don't use any of Meta's messaging
services. My preferred messaging service is [Signal][signal].
